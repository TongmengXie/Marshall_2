# Document-Term Matrix (DTM):
DTM is created from your corpus (Words) and represents the frequency of terms in each document.

# Cosine Similarity Computation:
- By dividing the dot product by the product of the magnitudes, you obtain the cosine similarity matrix, where each element [i, j] represents the cosine similarity between document i and document j.
- Cosine similarity values range from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates identical orientation (maximum similarity), 0 indicates orthogonality (no similarity), and -1 indicates opposite orientation.
