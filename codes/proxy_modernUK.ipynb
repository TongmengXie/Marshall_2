       "<description lang=\"en\" load-source=\"lhip\" data-format=\"original\"><p>Dispensing Mechanism for a Medical Device</p><p>The present invention relates to a dispensing mechanism for administering a dosage of a medicament. The present invention also relates to a medical device comprising a dispensing mechanism, an injection device comprising a dispensing mechanism and an inhaler comprising a dispensing mechanism.</p><p>Medical devices for administering medicament are known, for example liquid solutions or powders can be delivered to a user or patient using injection devices or powder inhalers respectively.</p><p>One such medical device for administering a liquid solution is an injection device comprising a dispensing mechanism in which the dosage to be administered may be set by a dosage button moveable by a user or patient. A subsequent further movement of the dosage button, typically in the proximal direction of the device, i.e. in a direction towards an injection site of the device on the patient’s skin, serves to inject the medicament using a ram to displace a plunger in a vial or cartridge of liquid medicament. A needle is typically attached to the cartridge in order to allow a subcutaneous delivery of the medicament. The dispensing mechanism ensures that a controlled and accurate dose may be administered.</p><p>However, such drive mechanisms often include several interacting component parts and thus packaging the components within a medical device that is optimal in size to carry and simplicity to use can be difficult. In addition, it cannot always be readily determined by a user of the device whether the correct dosage has been fully administered.</p><p>The present invention aims to alleviate at least to a certain extent at least one of the problems of the prior art.</p><p>According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a dispensing mechanism for administering a dosage of a medicament, the mechanism comprising: a dosage setting means, element, part or parts for setting a dose of medicament to be administered; expelling means, element part of parts for expelling a medicament from a medicament container; a coupling means, element, part of parts operatively coupled with the dosage setting means and the expelling means, wherein the coupling means is arranged to convert displacement of the dosage setting means into a displacement of the expelling means in a first direction, wherein the expelling means or coupling means includes a ratchet means, element, part or parts, and wherein the mechanism includes a first and a second independently moveable resisting pawl means or pawls facing a common side of the ratchet means, the first and the second resisting pawl means being configured to engage with the ratchet means and resist displacement of the expelling means in a second direction opposite to said first direction.</p><p>Advantageously, such a mechanism provides a compact arrangement and control of the expelling means. The resisting pawl means advantageously prevents movement of the expelling means during dose setting.</p><p>The dosage setting means may comprise a push button or other component which can be manually manipulated by a user.</p><p>Optionally, the ratchet means comprises a first and a second set of teeth, the first set of teeth being arranged to engage with the first resisting pawl means and the second set of teeth being arranged to engage with the second resisting pawl means.</p><p>The first and second sets of teeth are optionally each arranged in rows. The rows are optionally parallel and may be spaced from one another. The teeth preferably comprise peaks and valleys. The ridges of the peaks of each set of teeth are aligned transverse to the longitudinal axis of the expelling means. The teeth are preferably equally spaced in each row of teeth. The heights of the teeth are preferably equal.</p><p>Each tooth preferably comprises a front planar face and a rear planar face. The front planar face is preferably arranged proximally, i.e. nearer the point of contact with a patient’s skin, in use, in the mechanism. The front face is preferably inclined at a smaller angle to a plane extending parallel to a side of the body of the mechanism or device and the rear face of each tooth being inclined at a relatively larger angle to said plane.</p><p>The engaging faces are preferably the faces of the teeth against which the pawls may act to resist movement. The engaging faces are preferably the rear faces of the teeth in each row of teeth.</p><p>The pawls may be orientated with their free, ratchet-engaging ends angled towards a first, proximal end of the mechanism.</p><p>Optionally, the dosage setting means is linearly displaceable in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the expelling means.</p><p>Optionally, the dosage setting means is rotationally displaceable about an axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the expelling means.</p><p>Optionally, the dosage setting means is displaceable both axially and rotationally about an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the expelling means, for example where a screw thread arrangement is provided.</p><p>Optionally, the first and/or second resisting pawl means comprise(s) or are formed with a part of a body of the mechanism.</p><p>Optionally, the mechanism may be formed of a plastics material, a metallic material or a combination of both.</p><p>Optionally, the teeth pitch in each of the first set of teeth and the second set of teeth is substantially equal.</p><p>Optionally, engaging faces of the second set of teeth are arranged offset from engaging faces of the first set of teeth on the ratchet means.

ratchet of the expelling means of the dispensing mechanism of Figure .</p><p>Figure  shows a perspective view of a medical device including a dispensing mechanism generally indicated . The medical device  comprises an elongate body  with a substantially square cross-section with rounded edges between adjacent sides. However, it is envisaged that the body  may be formed in any suitable shape, for example with a circular cross-section or with varying cross section along the length of the device .</p><p>The size and the form of the body  may be designed to facilitate being held in a user or patient’s hand. The surface may be provided with surface protrusions or knurling or any other such surface texture to facilitate gripping of the device .</p><p>At a first, proximal end a of the body , i.e. the end nearest an injection site of a user in use, a cartridge receptacle  is attached, for example by a bonded or clipped engagement, to the body , for holding a medicament cartridge or carpule. The cartridge receptacle  is formed generally as a truncated cone and may be made transparent in order that a user may inspect the contents of the medicament cartridge to obtain a visual indication of the quantity of medicament remaining. The medicament cartridge may be filled with a liquid medicament, for example insulin.</p><p>A removable and disposable needle (not shown) may be attached to the cartridge receptacle  or to a threaded engagement  provided on the outer surface of a cylindrical part at the proximal end of the cartridge which, as shown in Figure , extends through the end of the cartridge receptacle . A typical needle comprises a rear needle part for puncturing a plastic stopper  provided at the proximal end of the medicament cartridge. The needle also comprises a forward needle part. In use, the forward needle part may be inserted subcutaneously into a patient so that medicament may be injected from the medicament cartridge into a patient.</p><p>At a second, distal end b of the body  of device , i.e. the end, in use, furthest from an injection site of a user, a dosage setting means or element is provided in the form of a push button . In the embodiment, the push button has a similar, generally square, cross-sectional shape to that of the body  of the device . However, different shapes and arrangements of the dosage means are envisaged. The dosage means  is typically sized to be gripped between a finger and thumb of a user. Figure  shows the push button  in a depressed, i.e. pushed-in state relative to the body  of the device .</p><p>The push button  may be pulled out away from the body  in a first distal direction in order to set a dose and pushed in towards the body  in a second proximal direction in order to administer a dose of medicament.</p><p>In Figure , the push button is shown in a first, pulled-out state, with the device ready to deliver a dose. The push button  comprises a drive shaft  connecting the push button to a drive mechanism within the body of the device.</p><p>The body , in the embodiment, is formed of two half-shells a, b. The body  is generally formed of a plastics material, which may be injection moulded or produced by any other suitable manufacturing technique.</p><p>Figure  shows the device  with one of the half-shells b removed to expose the internal drive mechanism of the device .</p><p>Within the body  of the device , an expelling means, element or part is provided in the form of a longitudinal drive rod . The rod  is linear in form and serves as a ratchet or ratchet means, with an upper surface comprising two sets of ratchet teeth a, b extending along at least part of the length of the rod . The teeth are orientated such that their lands, valleys or ridges of the peaks run transverse to the longitudinal direction of the device.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiment described herein, the teeth of one of the sets of ratchet teeth are offset from the teeth of the other set of ratchet teeth. However, it should be noted that such an Offset’ arrangement is only a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p>The sets of ratchet teeth in this example are separated by a longitudinal planar divider . The longitudinal rear side of the rod  is planar with a central protruding guide rib . Corresponding channels and support rails a, b are formed within the body  to receive the rod  and the guide rib  and allow linear movement thereof along the longitudinal axis of the device .</p><p>At the proximal end of the rod , the rod comprises an engagement ram a in the form of a circular disc. The ram a is formed and sized such that, in use, the ram a can engage with and displace a plunger  in a medicament cartridge received in the cartridge receptacle .</p><p>A coupling means, element, part or mechanism is provided to couple the dosage setting element with the expelling element. In the embodiment, the coupling means includes a first coupling element  connected to the push button  via a shaft . In the embodiment, the first coupling element  is formed integrally with the shaft . However, it is envisaged that the coupling element  could be operatively coupled to the push button  and/or shaft via a sprung or biased coupling so as to be moveable relative thereto.</p><p>The coupling element  comprises a pair of spaced planar sections of which only the upper planar section a is visible in Figure . However, a corresponding lower planar section is formed with the lower side of the shaft of the push button . The spaced planar sections a are perpendicular to the plane of the surface on which the ratchet teeth are provided. In the upper planar section a of the coupling element , a diagonal slot a is provided. The diagonal slot a extends diagonally in a direction across the body of the device.</p><p>The coupling further comprises a drive means or driver  which, as shown more clearly in Figure , comprises a pair of parallel and spaced planar arms a, b connected via a transverse web b towards a proximal end thereof. Each of the planar arms a, b comprises a circular protrusion or follower of which only the upper protrusion  a is visible in Figures  to .</p><p>The circular protrusion a of the upper planar arm a is received in the diagonal guide slot a of the upper planar section a of the coupling element. Although not shown, a corresponding circular protrusion is formed on the lower planar arm b and is received in a corresponding diagonal guide slot a in the lower planar section of the coupling element .</p><p>The underside of the upper planar section a of the coupling element  is supported on and slides atop of the upper planar arm a of the driver .</p><p>The driver  comprises a pair of drive pawls a, b extending from the web b. A gap is provided between the drive pawls a, b which fits around the divider  between the two sets of ratchet teeth a, b. The drive pawls are independently flexible about their connection with the driver .</p><p>The driver  comprises a cylindrical portion a which is pivotally located in a corresponding hole in the body  of the device . The cylindrical portion is rotatably engaged with the hole in the body  such that the driver  may rotate about the axis of the cylindrical portion, which acts therefore as a pivot axis.</p><p>The drive pawls a, b are arranged such that they can engage with a tooth respectively of each of the sets of ratchet teeth , although due to the offset in the sets of teeth, the drive pawls a, b do not necessarily contact the same part of a tooth in a respective set of teeth. For example, with an offset arrangement of the two sets of teeth in the drive rod, one drive pawl may be in engagement with a rear face of a tooth and the other drive pawl may be atop a ridge or peak of a tooth in the adjacent set of teeth. The drive pawls a, b of the driver  are angled towards the proximal end a of the body  of device . However, embodiments are envisaged where the teeth in each set of teeth are in adjacent alignment.</p><p>Figure  shows a further view of the device  as shown in Figure  with the push button  in a retracted or withdrawn position.</p><p>As can been in Figure  and , in the depressed state of the push button , the engagement protrusion a of the driver  is located at one end, the distal end, of the diagonal slot a of the coupling element . In the withdrawn position of the push button , the engagement protrusion a of the driver  is located at the other end, the proximal end, of the diagonal slot a of the coupling element . This change of position is achieved by the engagement protrusion a sliding in the diagonal slot a as the push button  is moved in a direction along the longitudinal axis of the device.</p><p>Because of the diagonal orientation of the slot a in the coupling element, the movement of the engagement protrusion a, which is formed with the driver , causes the driver  to rotate about the pivot point formed by the engagement of the cylindrical protrusion  of the driver  engaged in the body  of the device .</p><p>As the driver  is rotated clockwise about the pivot axis  by the push button  being depressed, one of the pawls a, b engages with at least one rear face of a tooth on one of the sets of ratchet teeth a such that the longitudinal rod  is displaced in a direction towards the distal end of the device.</p><p>Figures ,  and  show reverse side perspective views respectively of the views shown in Figures ,  and .</p><p>In Figure , the device  is shown with the push button  in a depressed state. The longitudinal drive rod  can be seen showing the upper side thereof in which the two sets of ratchet teeth a, b are provided separated by divider . The upper and lower drive pawls a, b can be engaged with teeth respectively in the first and second sets of ratchet teeth a, b, although as described above, due to the offset of the teeth in the two sets of teeth a, b, the drive pawls a, b do not necessarily contact the same portion of a tooth in a respective set of teeth.</p><p>Figure  shows the device  with the push button  in a withdrawn state. As can be seen from Figure , with the push button  in a depressed state or position, the driver  has been rotated about the pivot axis  thus engaging at least one of the drive pawls a, b with at least one rear face of a tooth of a set of ratchet teeth a, b and causing the drive rod  to be displaced in a proximal direction.</p><p>The drive pawls a, b are formed to allow a degree of flexing relate to the web b.</p><p>Figure  shows a view of the device  with the push button  in a depressed state. The device  is shown with the cartridge receptacle  removed. An aperture  can be seen in the proximal end a of the body  in which the drive rod  may extend in use to engage with the stopper of a medicament cartridge (not shown).</p><p>Figure  shows a view of the device  with a cut-out in the body . Through the cut-out, the drive rod  may be seen. Either side of the drive rod , the upper and lower arms a, b of the driver are located. The upper and lower drive pawls a, b can also be seen.</p><p>Spaced from the upper and lower drive pawls a, b, in the proximal direction of the body  of the device , a pair of resistance or resisting pawls a, b is provided. The resistance pawls a, b are formed with or attached to the body  of the device .</p><p>Figure  shows a further cut-away view of the body  of the device , but with the drive rod  removed. Here, the arrangement of the resistance pawls a, b and drive pawls a, b can be seen.</p><p>The resistance pawls a, b are angled in a direction towards the proximal end a of the body  of device . The resistance pawls are flexible to a certain degree with respect to the body  of the device .</p><p>The upper resistance pawl a can engage with the upper set of teeth a on the longitudinal rod , with the lower resistance pawl b engageable with the lower set of teeth b on the longitudinal rod . Due to the offset of the teeth between the teeth in one set of ratchet teeth to the teeth in the other set of ratchet teeth in this embodiment, the resistance pawls a, b may not contact the same part of a tooth in each of the first and second sets of ratchet teeth a, b.</p><p>The resistance pawls a, b serve to resist or prevent movement of the longitudinal rod  in a direction away from the proximal end a of the body  of device , by engaging the rear faces of the ratchet teeth a, b.</p><p>The operation of the device  will now be described with reference to Figures  and , which show cross sections A-A and B-B along the parallel longitudinal planes shown in Figure .</p><p>Figures  and  show the device  with the push button  in a depressed state. A medicament cartridge  is shown within the cartridge receptacle . A plunger  is provided within the medicament cartridge  which can be moved by engagement and displacement of the ram a of the longitudinal or drive rod , which serves to expel the medicament from the cartridge . Figure  is a lower side view of the device  and the description of the upper side as shown in Figure  is equally applicable to the lower side.</p><p>The upper resistance pawl a and the distal edge thereof can be seen engaged with a rear face of a tooth of the upper set of ratchet teeth a on the longitudinal drive rod .</p><p>The upper drive pawl a can also be seen engaged with a rear face of a tooth of the upper set of ratchet teeth a on the longitudinal or drive rod .</p><p>In order to set a dose, a user must withdraw the push button  in a direction away from the cartridge receptacle , i.e. in a distal direction with respect to the body  of device .</p><p>As the push button  is withdrawn, as has been described in relation to Figures  to , the sliding or engagement protrusion a on the upper drive arm a of the driver, which is located in the diagonal slot a of the coupling element , slides in the slot, causing the driver  to rotate in an anti-clockwise direction about the pivot axis . During this movement, due to the offset of the sets of ratchet teeth a, b, one of the resistance pawls a, b acts to resist movement of the drive rod  in a distal direction by engagement with the rear face of the tooth.</p><p>As the driver  rotates, one of the drive pawls a, b slides from between a space or valley between two longitudinally adjacent peaks of two teeth, over the front tooth face and ridge of a tooth such that it proceeds to be located in the longitudinally adjacent space or valley between successive teeth. The other of the drive pawls also moves, but due to the offset in the sets of ratchet teeth a, b does not necessarily end up on the same part of a tooth. At this stage, the push button is then in a retracted state as shown in Figures  and  which show cross sections D-D and C-C along the parallel longitudinal planes shown in Figure .</p><p>Upon the subsequent displacement of the dosage setting means  towards the proximal end a of the body  of device , the sliding protrusion a moves along the slot a in the coupling . As a result, the driver  rotates in a clockwise direction about the pivot point . One of the drive pawls a, b on the driver , normally a drive pawl positioned behind a peak of a tooth, engages with the rear face of the tooth in the set of ratchet teeth a, b in which it is located such that the longitudinal rod is displaced upon further movement of the dosage setting means in an axial direction in order to administer a dosage of medicament.</p><p>This operation, i.e. the continued withdrawal and subsequent depression of the push button , serves to move the drive pawls a, b successively into subsequent valleys or spaces between the teeth and drive the drive rod  towards the proximal end a of the body  of device . After the drive pawl reaches the surface a, b after the last tooth of the drive rod , no further displacement can be made.</p><p>The resistance pawls a, b are fixed to the body  of the device  and serve to resist or prevent movement of the drive rod (“expelling means”)  in a direction opposite to the administering direction, i.e. in a direction towards the proximal end a of the body  of device . This ensures a consistent displacement of the drive rod  in the proximal direction only and prevents backlash or displacement of the drive rod  in the distal direction.</p><p>All of the sets of ratchet teeth a, b are provided on a common side of the drive rod  and therefore all the resistance pawls a, b and drive pawls a, b are arranged to face a common side of the drive rod.</p><p>As the drive rod  is displaced in the proximal direction of the device , the resistance pawls a, b slide over the ratchet teeth a, b on the drive rod .</p><p>Figures a, a, , show more detailed side, plan and perspective views of adrive rod  having offset sets of teeth.</p><p>The drive rod  comprises two sets of ratchet teeth a, b separated by a divider . The two sets of ratchet teeth a, b are offset, i.e. engaging faces of the upper set of ratchet teeth a, are offset from the engaging faces of the lower set of ratchet teeth b in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the drive rod . This can be more clearly seen in details A and B shown in Figures b and b.</p><p>As shown in Figure b, each tooth has a ridge or peak c, a sliding front face a over which the pawls slide and an engagement rear face d as well a valley centre b. The teeth in each set of ratchet teeth a, b on opposing sides of the expelling means are equally spaced from one another. The offset between the two sets of ratchet teeth a ,b in the embodiment is equal to half the spacing between adjacent teeth in either of the first or second sets of ratchet teeth a, b.</p><p>In the embodiments described, the upper and lower resistance pawls a, b are arranged in adjacent alignment. Similarly, the upper and lower drive pawls a, b are also arranged in adjacent alignment. Due to the offset of the two sets of ratchet teeth a, b on the drive rod , when driving the driver , as described above, during each sequence of withdrawing the push button  and subsequently depressing the push button , only one set of resistance pawl a and drive pawl a engage fully with one set of the ratchet teeth, i.e. only one of the drive pawls a causes the drive rod  to be displaced and only one of the corresponding resistance pawls a prevents return movement of the drive rod . During a subsequent sequence, the other set of drive pawl b and resistance pawl b fully engages with the other set of ratchet teeth b, and so on.</p><p>Accordingly, the offset of the ratchet teeth a, b provides a ratchet with finer resolution of movement, which is equal to the distance between the valley of one tooth in one of the sets of ratchet teeth a and the valley of an adjacent tooth in the other of the sets of ratchet teeth b. This offset is shown in Figure b at item .</p><p>It follows that movement of the drive rod  in the embodiment described proceeds in smaller increments than if no offset were to be provided between the two sets of ratchet teeth a, b. This enables a finer dose or volume of medicament to be administered with the device  as a result of movement or displacement of the drive rod .</p><p>The offset in the case of a drive rod  with offset sets of ratchet teeth a, b may be adjusted according to requirements. For example, a drive rod  may be chosen with a larger tooth pitch in the sets of ratchet teeth in order to administer a large dosage during each cycle of movement. Conversely, a smaller pitch could be chosen. The other components however generally remain the same.</p><p>As previously mentioned, a drive rod  where the sets of ratchet teeth are in alignment is also envisaged. In such an embodiment, both drive pawls and resistance pawls would be in engagement with corresponding parts of teeth in each set of teeth at the same time in order to drive the expelling means and resist movement of the expelling means in the distal direction of the device.</p><p>With all of these embodiments, providing the ratchet teeth a, b on a single, common side of the drive rod  enables a more compact and simple device construction to be achieved.</p><p>As an alternative to offset teeth on the drive rod  , the adjacent ratchet teeth may be aligned with the drive pawls offset from one another. Indeed, a single set of ratchet teeth can be provided which can engage with each of the drive pawls and each of the resistance pawls.</p><p>It is envisaged that other coupling mechanisms may be provided to displace the drive rod and the present invention should not be considered limited to the exemplary coupling mechanism as shown in the Figures.</p><p>Figures  and  show a further embodiment of the device  having an indicator element  visible through a display window or aperture  provided in a surface of the body  of the device. Figures  and  have drive mechanisms configured to drive a drive rod  as described above in relation to Figures  to . However, the indicator element  and display window  arrangement of Figures  and  may be applied to devices with different drive mechanisms, including inhaler devices (not shown).</p><p>Figure  shows the device  with the push button  in a depressed state. In this position of the push button , a first state indicator a of “” provided on the indicator element  is visible in the window . This first state indicator a could for example indicate to a user that no dosage has been set by the push button .</p><p>Figure  shows the device  with the push button  in a withdrawn or retracted state. In this position of the push button , a second state indicator b of “” provided on the indicator element  is visible through the window . This second state indicator b could for example indicate to a user that a dosage of  units has been set for administration. Of course, other indications of state could be provided such as arrows or other visual or tactile markers or characters.</p><p>Figure  shows a view of the device  with part of the body removed to show the internal drive mechanism and also the mechanism to move the indicator element . The drive mechanism includes a driver  rotatable about a pivot axis . The driver  includes a protrusion a which engages through a diagonal, linear slot in a coupling element . The driver  drives a drive rod  provided with sets of ratchet teeth a, b. The drive rod  comprises a ram a which can be extended or displaced through an aperture  in order to displace a plunger in a medicament container such an insulin cartridge (not shown). The function of such a mechanism has already been described in relation to Figures  to  and will not be described further here.</p><p>The coupling  includes a planar surface a, as described above. The surface a is provided with distal and proximal protrusions a, b, which are spaced apart a distance greater than the axial length of the indicator element , which is disposed in the body  between said protrusions a, b.</p><p>A protrusion c is provided along an edge of the window , the protrusion c being configured to engage with each of two spaced indents a, b located along an edge of the indicator element  parallel to the direction of movement of the indicator element . When engaged with either of the indents a, b, the protrusion c acts to inhibit free axial linear movement of the indicator element , which in this embodiment is formed as a substantially rectangular planar element.</p><p>The indents a, b and the protrusion c combine with protrusions a, b on the body  to form motion conversion means, the function of which will now be described with reference to Figures  to  which are sectional views through section E-E as shown in Figure .</p><p>When the push button  of the device is fully depressed into the body  of the device, as shown in Figure , the indicator element  is positioned with its distal edge engaged with protrusion a towards the rear or distal end of the device body . The indication “” is shown in the window , represented by the dashed outline.</p><p>Upon initial withdrawal of the push button , as shown in Figure , the indicator element  remains stationary relative to the body  of the device thanks to protrusion c along the edge of window  engaging with rearmost indent a of the indicator element . This engagement acts to resist axial movement of the indicator element  relative to the body  such that the indicator element  slides over the surface of the coupling  when during an initial movement of the push button  and, as there is no movement of the indicator element  relative to the body , the indication “” remains visible to a user through window , indicating, for example, that the dosage has not yet been set.</p><p>Upon further withdrawal of the push button , as shown in Figure , the proximal protrusion b engages with the proximal edge of the indicator element , which causes the indicator element  to be displaced in a distal axial direction of the body  of the device, in doing so overcoming the resistance provided by the engagement of the protrusion c and distal indent a, such that the indication “” a begins to move out of visibility in the window .</p><p>Figure  shows the fully retracted position of the push button . Here it can be seen that the proximal protrusion b on the coupling  maintains its engagement with the indicator element  thereby completing the axial movement of the indicator element  to bring indication “” b into visibility in the display window . This could for example indicate to a user that the dosage has been correctly set and the push button  could be depressed in order to administer the dose. In this final fully withdrawn position of the push button , the protrusion c along the edge of window  becomes engaged with the foremost indent b on the edge of the indicator element .</p><p>Upon subsequent depression of the push button  in order to administer a dose, the indicator element  again initially remains stationary relative to the body  due to the resistance of protrusion c being engaged with the foremost indent b on the edge of the indicator element  such that the indication “” b remains visible in the window  during an initial movement of the push button . This could, for example, indicate to a user that the dose has not yet been fully administered.</p><p>Similarly as when the push button  is withdrawn, upon continued depression of the push button , the distal protrusion a on the coupling  engages with the corresponding distal edge of the indicator element  thereby to move it in the proximal direction relative to the body  of the device such that the indication “” a is again displayed in the window  and protrusion c again engages with rearmost protrusion a on the edge of the indicator element .</p><p>Although in the embodiment, the indicator element , here in the form of a sliding indicator, has been provided with indents a, b at each end of travel, it is also envisaged to provide a protrusion on the edge of the sliding indicator  which engages with corresponding indents provided on a corresponding edge of the window .</p><p>It will be understood that the mechanism provides a magnitude of displacement of the indication element  which is different to (i.e. less than) the magnitude of displacement of the dosage setting means. In the embodiment, the spacing of the protrusions a, b on the surface a of coupling  provides a relative or “lost motion” movement between the push button  and the indicator element . This allows the indications a, b to remain visible and unchanged during phases of the operation of the device. This can lead to improved operation of the device as the displayed indications a, b remain consistent and unchanged.</p><p>While in the embodiment, an axially moveable push button  has been shown to provide drive of the mechanism, other forms of dosage setting means may be provided such as a dial, rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the device while still embodying the abovedescribed arrangement of the indicator element . An example of such a dosage setting means with a rotating dial  on a cylindrical body  is shown in Figures  to  in a fully screwed in position in Figure , a fully retracted, i.e. screwed-out position in Figure  and a fully depressed position in Figure .</p><p>A further embodiment of a device  is shown in Figures  to  comprising a different indicator element arrangement. Externally, the device  is formed similarly to the embodiments described above, comprising a body , a cartridge receiver , a cartridge with a threaded portion  for receiving an injection needle, a push button or dosage means  and a window or aperture . Through the window , an indication, here the number “” is visible, which is on an indicator element .</p><p>Figure  shows a cross-section through the device shown in Figure . The dispensing mechanism is similar to that shown in Figures  to  and comprises a driver  with drive pawl a, b and resistance pawls a, b arranged to engage with ratchet teeth a, b on a drive rod .</p><p>A coupling element  is provided, which comprises a diagonal slot a within which a protrusion a is received. These parts function similarly to the coupling element  described in relation to Figures  to  in order to set a dose with the push means  and administer a dose. The dosage and administering functions will accordingly not be described further here.</p><p>In contrast to the device of Figures  to , as shown in Figure , the coupling element  comprises a rectangular aperture . Along one edge of the aperture, an opening  is provided in which a conversion means in the form of lever  is positioned. The lever  extends through the opening  into the aperture  from a pivoted connection  on the body  located outside the aperture .</p><p>The indicator element  is provided with a pair of spaced protrusions, represented by the dashed lines a, b. The protrusions a, b extend from the rear surface or underside of the indicator element  (not shown in Figures  or ) and are positioned towards either end of the indicator element  in the longitudinal direction of the device. When assembled, the protrusions a, b extend into the aperture  such that they are positioned either side of the distal end of the lever , i.e. the end of the lever  furthest from the pivoted connection , such that the indicator element  rests atop the lever .</p><p>Figure  shows the device with the push button  in a retracted position. Here it can be seen that the lever  is in contact with the rearmost or distal protrusion b of the indicator element  and is orientated such that the lever  is angled towards the distal end of the body .</p><p>Figure  shows an external view of the device of Figures  and  when the push button  is in a fully depressed position. In this position, the indicator element  now shows the indication “”. As has been described in relation to Figures  to , the indication “” can be used to indicate to a user that no dose has been set and the indication “” can be used to indicate that a doseof  units has been set, for example.</p><p>As can be seen in Figure , with the push button  in a fully depressed state, the rectangular aperture  has been axially displaced in the proximal direction of the device relative to the position of the rectangular aperture  of the device in the state shown in Figure . It can be seen that the opening  in the side of the aperture  has therefore also moved in a corresponding towards the proximal end of the body . As the lever  is pivotally attached to a fixed pivot  on the body of the device, the movement of the aperture  and the opening  therein causes rotation of the lever  about the pivot . As the distance between the pivot  and the opening  is less than the distance between the opening  and the distal end of the lever , it can be appreciated that a movement of the aperture  results in a movement of the distal end of the lever  of a greater magnitude, which moves the indicator element , via the protrusions a, b, a corresponding distance. Thus it can be seen that the opening  acts as a fulcrum .</p><p>The relative lengths of the lever  between the pivot  and the fulcrum  and the length between the fulcrum  and the distal end of the lever , or its point of contact with the protrusions a, b of the indication element , may be selected to produce a desired magnitude of movement of the indication element  relative to the dosage setting means .</p><p>As shown in Figure , in the depressed state of the push button , the distal end of the lever  is in contact with the protrusion a of the indicator element  towards the proximal end of the body  and has moved the indicator element  such that the indication “” is now visible in the aperture or window  as shown in Figure .</p><p>The lever  acts to convert a movement of a first magnitude of the push button  or coupling  into a movement of a second, greater magnitude of the indicator element . In a device with limited space, the lever  can provide a greater movement and functionality of the indicator element  than if the movement of the indicator element  was limited only to the same magnitude or degree of movement of the push button . For example, a mm movement of the indicator element  can result from just a mm axial movement of the push button , thereby providing a “gained motion” effect.</p><p>It will be understood however, that the opening  or fulcrum  and lever  may be arranged with a shorter distance between the opening  and the distal end of the lever  than the distance between the pivoted end  of the lever  and the opening  such that a smaller magnitude of movement of the indicator element  is achieved relative to the magnitude of movement of the push button .</p><p>As a further alternative, the lever  may be formed of a resiliently flexible material such that when the indicator element  reaches the limit of its movement, if the lever  should be caused to rotate further, for example if the manufacturing tolerances of the lever  are such that it is slightly longer or wider than necessary or if the fulcrum  or opening  position is not precisely located, the lever  will flex to prevent damage to itself or to the indicator element .</p><p>Figures  to  show some assembly steps of the device with the lever. Figure  shows the body, driver  and drive rod  located in the body . The body  is formed with a circular aperture  for receiving a support  of the lever .</p><p>Figure  shows the support  of the lever  located in the aperture . The lever  is pivotable about the axis of the circular aperture . Although shown in Figure  as a separate part in the embodiment, the lever  could be formed integrally with the body , yet still able to pivot.</p><p>Figure  shows the device with the coupling  attached to the push button  fitted. The lever  can be seen located in the opening  provided along one longitudinal side of the rectangular aperture .</p><p>Finally, Figure  shows the indicator element  positioned atop the coupling  and hence lever . The indicator element  is formed with the lever-engagable protrusions a, b underneath, which were shown and described in relation to Figures  and .</p><p>The indicator element  is shown provided with indents a, b, which have a similar function to the indents a, b described in relation to Figure  and  to  to resist free motion of the indicator element .</p><p>Although not shown in the Figures, it is envisaged that instead of a lever , the conversion means could comprise geared or threaded components, with the gearing or threading being chosen or configured such that a predetermined magnitude of movement of the indicator element  is achieved for a predetermined differing magnitude of movement of the push button .</p><p>In each of the aforementioned embodiments, the dosage setting means  could be indirectly or directly coupled to the indication element , . The indicator element ,  is typically constrained within a channel or guide elements to limit the lateral movement thereof.</p><p>Figure  shows an alternative dispensing mechanism provided in a device . The device  includes a medicament container in the form of a cartridge receptacle . Within the cartridge receptacle , a cartridge is contained with a screw thread  at the proximal end to receive a needle.</p><p>Similarly to the embodiments shown in Figures  to , the dispensing mechanism comprises a dosage setting means in the form of a push button . The dosage setting means is formed with a shaft  connecting the push button  with a plate  in which a diagonal slot a is formed similarly to the embodiments of Figures  to . Accordingly, this aspect of the embodiment will not be described in further detail.</p><p>An expelling means  is provided in the form of a ram with a circular disc  to engage with the plunger of a cartridge in order to dispense a liquid medicament therefrom.</p><p>A drive element  is provided. The drive element  comprises an arm a connected towards the proximal end thereof to a pivot point  formed in the body  of the mechanism. At the distal end of the drive element of driver, a circular protrusion or follower a is provided which engages with the diagonal slot a in the plate  of the dosage setting means .</p><p>The drive element  comprises a further pair of arms b which extend from the distal end of the driver  in the proximal direction of the mechanism and device and angled relative the arm a connected to the pivot point . Each of the pair of arms b comprises at their proximal, free ends, a drive pawl c.</p><p>The expelling means  comprises a rack of teeth  which are formed to engage with the teeth c of a drive wheel . The drive wheel  has a central section c formed as a gear wheel which engages with the teeth  of the rack of the expelling means .</p><p>The drive wheel  is formed with two ratchet wheels a, b at either end. The ratchet wheels a, b have a larger diameter to the diameter of the central gear wheel c. The teeth of the ratchet wheels are offset relative to one another, i.e. the faces of the teeth in one ratchet wheel are offset from the faces of the teeth in the other ratchet wheel. Similarly to the embodiments described in relation to Figures  to , this can provide a finer movement and thus dosage.</p><p>Biasing pawls  are formed with the body  and are angled in the proximal direction of the device. Two such biasing pawls are provided. One upper biasing pawl engages with one of the ratchet wheels a and the other, lower biasing pawl engages with the other of the ratchet wheels b. It can therefore be seen that these biasing pawls  serve to prevent anticlockwise (as seen in Figures m, ) rotation of the drive wheel and can therefore be seen to act similarly to the biasing pawls described in relation to Figures  to . The biasing pawls  face a common side of the ratchet wheels provided on the drive wheel.</p><p>Figure  shows the device  with the push button  in a depressed position. As can be seen from Figures  and , upon withdrawal of the push button  into the withdrawn position as shown in Figure , the protrusion a on the driver  follows the diagonal slot a such that the driver  is caused to rotate anticlockwise about the pivot point . In so doing, the drive pawls c slide over the teeth in the ratchet wheels a, b, thus moving into successive valleys formed by the ratchet teeth. The biasing pawls  prevent rotation of the drive wheel in an anticlockwise direction during this movement of the drive pawls.</p><p>Upon the subsequent depressing of the push button  in the axial proximal direction, the driver  is caused to rotate about the pivot point . Due to the offset of the ratchet teeth in the ratchet wheels a, b, only one of the drive pawls a, b engages fully with an engaging face of one of the ratchet wheels a, b and rotates the ratchet wheel  about its axis  in a clockwise direction as viewed in Figure .</p><p>As the drive wheel  rotates, the gear teeth c, which are engaged with the rack of teeth  on the expelling means , rotate causing the expelling means to be displaced in an axial direction to deliver or administer a dose from the cartridge.</p><p>Figure  shows the expelling means , driver  and drive wheel . Due to the larger relative diameters of the ratchet wheels a, b to the size of the gear wheel c on the drive wheel , the expelling means sits between the drive arms c of the driver . This again allows for a more compact arrangement of components.</p><p>Figure  shows a view of the drive wheel . Each ratchet wheel a, b shares the same axis of rotation as the central gear wheel c located therebetween. The ratchet wheels a, b may be formed integrally with the gearwheel c.</p><p>As with the embodiments of Figures  to , the drive pawls could be offset rather than the ratchets on the drive wheel, with the ratchets of the drive wheel being in alignment.</p><p>Various modifications may be made to the embodiments described without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims. Furthermore, a skilled person will note that, though the terms “upper” and “lower” are used throughout the description for ease of reference to the figures, these terms are interchangeable with other differentiating terms for similar or identical features such as “first” and “second”, for example.</p></description>



       "<description lang=\"en\" load-source=\"lhip\" data-format=\"original\"><p>Improved Barrier Connection System and Method Thereof</p><p>The present invention relates to a connection system for forming a barrier such as a safety barrier or the like and in particular, to an impact barrier to protect pedestrians or equipment from impact, for instance from vehicles.</p><p>Impact barriers are known where a series of posts are installed anchored to a ground surface. The posts can be interconnected by rails or the like to form a pedestrian, vehicular or other barrier. In such systems, in the event of an impact, the forces are transferred through the post and into the ground. The strength of the connection to the ground surface is therefore important and typically a strong anchor connection is required.</p><p>It is advantageous from a cost and reliability point of view that the posts and rails are formed from a high strength plastic material. Typically, these parts are extruded and cut to size.</p><p>To adequately act as an impact barrier, the posts and rails of the barrier must be secured together so as to remain connected during impact from a vehicle. It is known to secure plastic post and rails together using an interlocking arrangement as disclosed in EP. Here a tubular post and rail are arranged to interconnect with each other by the rail having an opening which lies within the hollow interior of the post, and a third component inserted into the opening to lie within the hollow interior of the first component thus locking all three components together. This arrangement requires the rail to be a smaller size to the post so that the rail can fit through the post’s aperture. Typically, to achieve the desired strength, the post is more than % bigger than the rail. When the rail and post fit within one another, if a section of the barrier becomes damaged and needs to be replaced, it is necessary to dissemble the entire barrier, even though only a small number of the posts and I or rails need to be replaced. This is particularly relevant where the rail fits within the post because here the posts at either end of the rail that needs to be replaced have to be moved apart to withdraw the rail.</p><p>Whilst the posts can be installed by burying part of the extrusion to anchor it directly to the ground, this is often not possible or desirable. Rather, usually a ground anchor is used such as disclosed in EP, here the posts are secured to a foot plate that is then secured to the ground. Known foot plates are typically formed from metal such as steel. Here the footplates have a sleeve part that extends a substantial way up the length of the extrusion in order to receive and secure the plastic post. A plate part extends from the sleeve part at a generally orthogonal angle to the length of the sleeve so as to be parallel to the ground when the post is upright. The plate part extends outwards from the sleeve so that fixings can be secured there though to anchor the foot plate to the ground. For instance, typically the plate part is square and bolts are secured through holes in each corner. Known ground anchors secure the post and footplate in a fixed manner so that other than the flex in the post, the full force of the impact is transmitted through the ground anchor.</p><p>It is an object of the present invention to attempt to overcome at least one of the above or other disadvantages. It is a further aim to provide an impact barrier with improved manufacturability, improved installation and improved reparability. It is a further aim to provide improved connection between the post and ground anchor, and post and rail.</p><p>According to the present invention there is provided an impact barrier and method of assembling and repairing an impact barrier as set forth in the appended claims. Other features of the invention will be apparent from the dependent claims, and the description which follows.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments barriers are described having posts and rails. Typically the element connected at a distal end is termed the post and the element connected at a mid section along its length is termed the rail. The posts and rails are typically interconnected perpendicularly to each other to form the barriers. However, other angles are envisaged. The posts and rails are suitably hollow, however, solid elements with suitable hollow sections are also envisaged. Moreover, although the exemplary embodiments are described in relation to tubular elements having a circular cross-section, other cross-sections such as square or rectangle or other geometric shape are envisaged as well as combinations of the same. Typically the posts and rails are extruded to form hollow elements having constant crosssection. Though other manufacturing methods are possible. In the exemplary embodiments, the posts and rails are formed from a plastics material. Metal or other suitable materials are also possible. Indeed, the barrier systems described herein provide an improved connection method between the posts and rail and post and footplate, and the general design and construction of other parts of the barrier system may include compatible features and constructions as known in the art.</p><p>According to a first aspect there is provided a barrier having first and second spaced posts interconnected by a rail, wherein the rail and posts are not inserted within one another. In the exemplary embodiments, the parts are hollow in at least the region of the intended interconnection. Each post is connected to the rail by a coupling. Each coupling includes a connector that is arranged to extend inside the hollow region of the post and inside the hollow region of the rail. Here, the post includes an aperture wherein when assembled the connector is arranged to extend through the aperture. The connecter includes an abutment that abuts an inside of the post to prevent movement of the connector through the aperture. The connector is arranged to be moveable further into one of the hollow sections of the post or rail to withdraw the connector from the other of the post or rail. This allows the rail to be disconnected from the post without increasing the distance between the two spaced posts.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, the posts are interconnected by a single rail. However, it will be appreciated that the posts may be interconnected by at least one rail. Here other rails may be provided. In this case each of the plurality of rails between two respective posts is suitably interconnected as herein described. Moreover, it will be appreciated to those skilled in the art that although a minimum of two posts is required typically a barrier will comprise a plurality of sequentially spaced posts, where each intermediate post is connected to an adjacent post by a rail. End posts in the sequence are connected to one other post. Intermediate posts in the sequence are typically connected to two or more posts. Although the system has been described as requiring two posts, one or both of the posts may be a wall or other structure providing a fixed connection to the rail.</p><p>The abutment of the connector is arranged within the post and may suitably be arranged to contact the inside of the post once assembled or the abutment may be brought into contact during an impact and as the rail is urged to pull away from the post. In one embodiment, the abutment is fixed relative to the connector for instance the abutment is an integral piece of the abutment such as a bulbous head, or the abutment may be substantially permanently fixed within or to the connector such as a glued pin. In this embodiment, the connector is arranged to be withdrawn into the hollow section of the post. In other exemplary embodiments, the abutment is in removable contact with the inside of the post. That is, during normal use, the abutment contacts the inside of the post to prevent the connector from moving through the aperture. However, to disassemble the rail from the post, the abutment is removed from contacting the inside of the post so that the connector may be moved through the aperture to withdraw the connector from the post. For instance, here, the abutment may be a bulbous head wherein the bulbous head may be able to be restricted in size so as to pass through the aperture. The size restriction is suitably applied by a force angled and preferably perpendicular to the direction of withdrawal. The bulbous head may contact one side of the aperture and be flexed towards the other side or the bulbous head may include a slot in the direction of withdrawal into which two opposed sides of the bulbous head can flex.</p><p>Alternatively, in other embodiments, the connector comprises a main body and a moveable first fixing, wherein the fixing is able to be moved relative to the main body to move the fixing from an abutment position to a free position. Suitably the fixing is moveable in a direction at an angle and preferably perpendicular to the direction of withdrawal of the connector from the post. In some exemplary embodiments, the fixing is removable from the main body. For instance the fixing is a pin that can be moved into the main body or removed from the main body to free the abutment from contacting the inside of the post. In this case the first fixing is suitably an elongate pin. Here the pin may have a generally circular cross section. The pin may be rigid, or may include a force absorption feature as described in the third aspect.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, the part of the coupling that extends into the rail may have a substantial length such that when, in use, the rail is impacted and caused to pull away from the post, the coupling remains within the rail during the expected distance of travel. However, in this instance the length may be restricted if the connector is caused to move into the post, for instance because the abutment is fixed. Consequently, it is advantageous for the connector to include a second abutment. Wherein the second abutment acts on a part of the rail to retard movement of the rail away from the post. The second abutment may be fixed or removable as described in relation to the first abutment herein. In the exemplary embodiments, the second abutment acts through an aperture within the rail. Here, at least one of the abutments is in removable contact so that the abutment can be removed to allow the coupling to move into one of the post or rail.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments comprising removable fixings, suitably the removable fixings extend, in use, from both sides of the coupling body.</p><p>Advantageously, because the posts and rail are not inserted within one another, the rail can be assembled or disassembled from the impact barrier without moving the posts. For example, with the posts secured in place the coupling can be assembled to one of the post or rail so that it extends fully within said post or rail. With the rail offered up to the post, the coupling can be moved to extend into the other of the post or rail. Here the first and second fixing members secure the coupling in place. In reverse, the at least one removable fixing member is removed allowing the coupling to be moved fully within one of the post or rail. The rail is therefore disconnected from the post and can be replaced without having to remove the post. Thus an improved installation method is provided and discrete sections of the impact barrier can be repaired without the need to disassemble comparatively large portions of the impact barrier.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments wherein the coupling is arranged to move into the rail, the aperture through the post is advantageously smaller than the inner dimension of the rail. Consequently, the part of the coupling that extends into the post is smaller than the part of the coupling that extends into the rail. Here, the connector includes opposed ends, one of which is larger than the other and sized so as to fit within the rail and the other end is respectively smaller and sized so as to fit through the aperture. Advantageously, this allows the outer dimensions of the post and rail to be substantially the same giving a seamless appearance to the barrier. In these exemplary embodiments, the coupling includes a collar at the intersection between the end that is arranged within the post and the end arranged within the rail. The collar is suitably a raised ring. The raised ring is shaped to fit against the rail to one side and the post to the other and therefore provides a more seamless appearance.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, the first and I or second abutments retard movement of the respective post and rail to the coupling in a direction of movement of the rail being caused to pull away from the post. Whilst the abutments may be rigid to substantially fully retard the movement, this tends to create excessive forces within the barrier that can cause catastrophic failure in the coupling even upon relatively small impacts. Whilst the couplings are designed to be replaced after failure, in some instances, it is advantageous to provide the fixing with an energy absorption feature so that the coupling can dissipate some of the energy from an impact by allowing some movement within the connector. Consequently, it is advantageous if one or both abutments act against a localised area of reduced resistance to deformation as described in the second aspect or if one or both abutments include an area having a reduced resistance to deformation to control movement of first and second opposed faces of the abutment and as described in relation to the third aspect.</p><p>Yet further, it may be beneficial to provide localised areas of reduced deformation on both sides of the abutment and on opposed sides of a shearing action caused by the rail pulling away from the post and as described in relation to the fourth aspect.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, the connector has been described as sliding within the rail to withdraw the coupling from the post. This may be achieved by a mechanical feature such as a handle on the connector extending through a slot of the rail. For instance the handle may be part of the second abutment. However, the connector may also be moved by finger walking the connector through an aperture, for instance the aperture available once a removable abutment has been removed.</p><p>According to a second aspect there is provided a barrier having a first part inserted into a second part and prevented from separating by a fixing member. The fixing member acts against a substantially rigid area of one of the parts to one side and against a localised area of the other of the parts having increased deformability to the opposed side relative to the insertion direction of the first and second parts.</p><p>Here the substantially rigid area is relatively rigid compared to the localised area of reduced resistance to deformability and includes the substantially rigid area being formed from plastic.</p><p>The first part may be a footplate and the second part may be a post. Alternatively, the first part may be a rail and the second part a post. Alternatively the first part may be a connector and the second part a post or rail such as in the first aspect.</p><p>Advantageously, in the event of a collision, instead of the two parts being held rigidly together that tends to cause a catastrophic failure of one or both parts, the fixing member slips by deforming the localised area of increased deformability. This slipping helps absorb and dissipate the energy from the impact and decreases the catastrophic failure of the parts.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, the localised area of increased deformability, or in other terms, the localised area of reduced resistance to deformability is a resilient area. Suitably, the area comprises a compressible material wherein the volume of the material decreases. Alternatively, the area comprises a deformable material that deforms whilst maintain substantially the same volume. Advantageously, when the localised area of increased deformability is resilient, the impact barrier can return to an undamaged state after impact.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, the localised area is formed by providing a slot and partially filling the slot with a second material, to leave at least an aperture for receiving the fixing. Here, the fixing acts against a surface of the slot to one side and against the localised area to the other. Depending on the material used, the localised area may be secured within the part for example with adhesive or mechanical fixing. If a compressible material is used, the material may substantially fill the slot once the fixing is in place. However, when using a deformable material, space is required for the material to deform into.</p><p>The localised area of increased deformability may be provided by the first part or the second part or both. In the exemplary embodiments, the first and second parts are formed from a plastics material. The first part including the localised area of increased deformability includes a pocket filled with a second material having increased deformability with respect to said part.</p><p>In one exemplary embodiment the fixing member is substantially rigid. However, the pin may also include some resilient deformability as explained in the third aspect. The fixing member is suitably an elongate member. Here the fixing member contacts the rigid portion of the first member either side of the localised area of increased deformability and in a direction angled to the insertion direction of the two parts. However, the fixing member may not necessarily be elongate and may have two parts, wherein the parts may be separate or integral. In the exemplary embodiments the fixing member is suitably shown as an elongate pin. However, other fixing members are envisaged, for instance a clip.</p><p>Yet further, the fixing has been described in the second aspect as acting against a relatively rigid area to one side. For instance the edge of the slot contacts the fixing to substantially move the fixing with the slot. Whilst this allows the two parts in parallel by deforming the localised area equally on both sides, it also allows the two parts to pivot relative to each other by deforming one side more than the other. Whilst a pivot provides an enhanced energy absorption feature, the fixing is required to be arranged parallel to a direction of impact. However, the pivot axis here is at an edge or outside of the second part. Consequently, and as described in the fourth aspect, the fixing may be arranged to act against a localised area of reduced deformability to both sides of a shearing force caused by the first and second parts attempting to move relative to each other and as described in the fourth aspect.</p><p>According to a third aspect there is provided an impact barrier having a first part inserted into a second part and prevented from separating by a fixing member. The fixing member having a first side that acts against an area of one of the parts and a second side, opposed to the first side in a direction of insertion relative to the insertion direction of the first and second parts, that acts against an area of the other of the parts. The fixing member being formed from a first area having a relatively high resistance to deformation and a second area having a relatively lower resistance to deformation. Wherein the first area forms at least one of the first or second sides. The second area being arranged so that in use and when an impact force acts to pull the first part from the second part, the second part controls movement of the first area towards the second area.</p><p>The area having a relatively high resistance to deformation is a hard area or a rigid area. The area having a reduced resistance to deformation is a soft or deformable area.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, the fixing member is substantially elongate. Here, the fixing member comprises a pin. Typically the pin is based on a substantially cylindrical shape though other shapes are possible.</p><p>In one exemplary embodiment, the first area and second areas are formed on opposed sides of the fixing member. For instance, the fixing member is an elongate pin and one side of the elongate pin is formed from a substantially rigid area and the other side is formed from a relatively softer area. The relatively softer area is caused to deform to control movement of the rigid area towards the outer surface of the softer area.</p><p>Again, the area of reduced resistance to deformation may be a compressible area or a deformable area. The area may preferably be resilient. When using a deformable material, space is required to allow the material to deform into. Consequently, in the exemplary embodiment, grooves are formed in the fixing or surface to provide space for the deformable material to move into. For example, the face of the fixing includes grooves such as elongate grooves in the surface of the softer material.</p><p>The fixing member is shaped so as to provide a large surface area in contact with the parts. Here, the fixing member includes flared sides from a generally circular profile wherein the flared sides allow the fixing member to conform more closely to the part it abuts thereby increasing the surface area.</p><p>In alternative exemplary embodiments, one of the areas is arranged to surround the other. For instance, the rigid area may provide both the first and second opposed sides. Here, the fixing member comprises a rigid body having a hollow. The softer material is arranged within the hollow. Again a compressible material may fill the hollow, but if a deformable material is used the material may only partially fill the hollow to allow space for the material to deform. In one exemplary embodiment, the hollow includes a central rigid area.</p><p>According to a third aspect there is provided an impact barrier having a first part inserted into a second part and prevented from separating by a fixing member. The two parts in use are caused to separate which generates a shearing force on the fixing member. A first localised area of one of the parts having reduced resistance to deformation acts to control movement of the fixing member relative to one of the parts as a result of the shear force. The localised area deforming to provide the control.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, a second localised area of reduced resistance to deformation is provided. Here the second area is provided so as to act to allow movement of the fixing pin relative to one of the parts in an opposed direction of shear and caused by one of the parts pivoting relative to the other. Corresponding third and fourth areas of reduced deformability may be provided on opposed sides of the fixing as to the first and second areas so as to accommodate an impact in two opposed directions.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments, the fixing is an elongate pin that extends from both sides of the first part. Here, the elongate pin may extend through the first part and act against a localised area to one side. For instance, a pocket including a material with the required characteristics. The material may surround the elongate pin. For instance a ring of material may be inserted with a larger aperture in the first part. The first or second area may be provided on the second part or may be provided on the first part. The first and second areas may also be provided on the same part or on alternate parts.</p><p>In one exemplary embodiment, a second fixing is provided. The second fixing is arranged at an angle to the first and preferably perpendicular thereto. Suitably at least one of the first and second fixings may be formed in two parts to allow the first and second fixings to intersect on the same plane. In the exemplary embodiments, the first and second fixings are held rigid to each other so that pivotal movement of one of the fixings causes movement of the other. In the exemplary embodiments, the first and second fixings are interconnected by a ball. Here the ball is central to the first part and allows the pivot axis of the fixings to be arranged at the centre of the first part.</p><p>In the exemplary embodiments one of the first or second part is arranged to statically retain the fixings. That is the fixings are arranged within apertures of said part and abut relatively hard areas of the part on all sides. The other of the parts dynamically retains the fixing wherein the fixing is arranged within an aperture and contacts an area of said part having reduced resistance to deformation. Preferably, the fixing contacts two spaced areas across the fixing of each part. The part holding the fixing dynamically having a first area of reduced resistance to deformation on opposed sides at the respective two locations. In one exemplary embodiment, the part holding the fixing dynamically has an area of reduced deformation at both opposed sides of the fixing and at both spaced locations.</p><p>The first part suitably includes chamfered or tapered distal end relative to the insertion direction. The chamfers reduce point loading on the second part and encourage the second part to pivot relative to the first. Due to the material characteristics of the second part, the second part may also stretch as well as pivot.</p><p>The above aspects and exemplary embodiments of a barrier are suitably a safety barrier such as an impact barrier. However, the barriers may also be other barriers such as segregation barriers and partition barriers.</p><p>Fora better understanding of the invention, and to show how embodiments of the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which:</p><p>Figure  shows a cross sectional view of a barrier comprised of a rail between two posts in an assembled orientation and an arrangement ready for disassembling the rail from the posts;</p><p>Figure  shows a crossO-sectional view of an alternative barrier comprised of a rail between two posts in an assembled orientation and an arrangement ready for disassembling the rail from the posts;</p><p>Figure  shows a cross-sectional view through an exemplary coupling between a post and rail;</p><p>Figure  shows a top view of Figure  before and at a point of impact;</p><p>Figure  shows a perspective view of an exemplary fixing;</p><p>Figures  and  show perspective views of a rod and sheath respectively for forming a further exemplary embodiment of a fixing;</p><p>Figure  shows a top view of a post and rail connection employing the fixing of Figure ;</p><p>Figure  shows a perspective view of an exemplary foot plate for connection to a post;</p><p>Figures  and  show a cross section view through a post connected to the foot plate of Figure  and respectively before and during a point of impact; and</p><p>Figure  shows a side view of an exemplary barrier.</p><p>Referring to Figure  a barrier  is shown. The barrier comprises two spaced posts  and an interconnecting rail . The rail is connected to each post by a coupling . The rail and post are extruded tubular plastic elements and have hollow areas  and  at the intersection of the rail and posts. Each coupling  includes a connector  that extends into the hollow section of the post and the hollow section of the rail. The post therefore has a through hole into which the connector is inserted. An abutment  on the connector  abuts an inside surface of the hollow region  of the post. The abutment  is arranged to restrict the connector from moving through the through hole in the post. Consequently, when the rail is impacted during use, the rail moves away from the post but the length of the connector  ensures that the connector remains within the rail. During installation or if the rail or other component of the barrier requires replacement, the connector  is slid into only one of the hollow sections  or . For instance at one end the connector is shown in Figure  as being moved into the post so that the connector no longer extends into the rail. As such, the abutment does not have to be removed from engagement and can therefore be a fixed head or glued pin. However, due to the space requirements this may restrict the length of the connector. Alternatively at the opposite end an alternative embodiment is shown wherein the abutment is removed from contacting the inside of the hollow post. This allows the connector to be slid entirely within the rail. Consequently the post may be removed without having to uninstall the posts. A rail is installed by offering up the rail and moving the connectors back into the hollow area  of the rail. And the abutments brought into contact.</p><p>The sliding of the connectors can be done by manually reaching into the posts from the top or by using tools. Alternatively, the connector may have a handle for using to move the connector. Or a hole may be used to walk the connector along the rail.</p><p>The embodiment wherein the connector slides into the rail is advantageous as it allows the hole through the post to be sized smaller than the inside dimension of the rail. This allows a rail and post of the similar size to be utilised. However, the abutment needs to be arranged to be disengaged either by moving the abutment or by removing the abutment from the connector. As shown in Figure , the abutment is suitably a first fixing such as an elongate pin that extends from both sides of the connector and is preferably removable from the coupling to remove the abutment from abutting the inside edges of the hollow area.</p><p>Figure  shows an alternative embodiment wherein a second abutment  on the connector also abuts the rail . Here both abutments need to be removed before sliding the connector out of contact with one of the parts, shown as the posts. Again, the abutment is shown as a removable fixing such as a pin . The pin is elongate and extends through an aperture of the connector so as to abut the rail on both sides.</p><p>In the embodiments described above, the fixings are held substantially fast to the connector in a direction along an axis of the rail. This creates a rigid structure that attempts to prevent any movement of the rail away from the post. However, in at least impact barriers, it is advantageous for the barrier to include some movement at the joint in order to absorb some of the forces of the impact. Consequently, as shown in Figure , the connector  includes a slot . The slot is larger than the fixing (not shown) and allows the fixing to move relative to the coupling. As shown the fixing and rail  remain static relative to each other as the fixing is held in holes  on either side of the rail. The slot  is filled with a material  having a reduced resistance to deformation. For instance, the slot  may be filled with a compressible material such as a foam or a deformable material such as rubber. If a deformable material is used, space within the slot will need to be kept free to enable the rubber to deform.</p><p>As will be appreciated, the coupling is shown in figure  as extending into the post. The first fixing (not shown) extends through aperture  to abut either side of the hole through which the coupling extends. Referring now to Figure , the barrier is shown in an initial rest position wherein the rail is secured to the post by the coupling comprising the connector held to the post and rail by respective fixings. As the barrier is impacted, the rail is caused to pull away from the post. The second fixing  is held statically relative to the rail and therefore moves with the rail. The first fixing causes an abutment with the inside of the post and therefore resists the connector from being pulled away from the post. Consequently the second fixing  is allowed to move by deformation of the material . The deformation controls the movement of the rail away from the post and the impact absorption can be changed by using different material characteristics. Once the material  has been fully deformed, the rail and fixing become locked together again and further movement of the rail away from the post need to be accommodated by failure or by the material characteristics of the post and rail or elsewhere in the system. If the material  is resilient, the barrier may return to the first state and not need replacing.</p><p>It will be appreciated that although the fixing has been described as being static to the rail with the coupling including the area of reduced resistance to deformation, the parts may be reversed wherein the fixing is static to the connector and the material  arranged within a slot in the rail.</p><p>Whilst the first fixing  may also be arranged to slip within on of the parts, the space within the post is often more limited. Consequently additionally or alternatively, a fixing  having an impact absorption feature as shown in Figures  to Figure , may be used as one or both of the fixings ,  and separately or in addition to the slip movement feature.</p><p>Figure  shows a first embodiment of a fixing member  arranged to prevent a first part of an barrier separating from a second part of the barrier. The fixing member  is shown with a first side  and a second side . The first side  of the fixing member  acts against one of the parts of the barrier. The fixing member  has a substantially constant cross-section and is particularly elongate and shaped like a prism, particularly a triangular prism. The corners of the prism are curved in order to improve the distribution of forces acting on and through the fixing member  towards the impact barrier. The second side  of the fixing member  is shown to substantially occupy one face of the prism whereas the first side  substantially covers two faces of the prism. In this embodiment, the first side  and second side  have different locating means. For instance, the first side  is located within the impact barrier by the two faces of the triangular prism whereas the second side  is located using a corrugated surface. The first side  of the fixing member  is formed from a first area  and the second side  of the fixing member  is formed from a second area  to produce the constant cross-section of the prism shape.</p><p>It can be appreciated that the fixing member  is composed of varying resistances to deformation to aid the absorption forces on impact. For instance, the first side  of the fixing member  has a high resistance to deformation, whereas the second side  has a relatively lower resistance to deformation. Therefore, it may be said that the first side  is rigid compared to a softer second side . When the fixing member  is slotted into position, the first side  of the fixing member  is pressed against the impact barrier (X) which causes the softer second side  to compress and allow the two parts of the impact barrier (X) to be secured.</p><p>During impact, and as the first and second parts are cause to produce a shearing effect on the fixing, movement of the first face towards the second face is controlled by deformation of the softer area and thereby absorbs some of the energy from the impact.</p><p>Figure  and  shows a second embodiment of the fixing member . The fixing member  is shown as an elongate member and is in the form of pin. The fixing member  is comprised of an inner core and  and outer sheath . The fixing member includes varying resistances to deformation in order to improve the distribution of forces on impact. For instance, the inner core  has a relatively soft outer layer  with a low resistance to deformation and is coupled to a relatively harder inner layer  with a higher resistance to deformation. This varying resistances help to improve the transfer of forces through the fixing member . The outer layer  wraps around the inner layer  to allow the outer layer to consistently contact the impact barrier (X) and more evenly distribute and absorb the impact forces. The outer layer  is shown as a mesh-like lattice structure with interconnecting cross-members and a plurality of recesses . These recesses  allow the relatively soft outer layer  to spread outwardly and towards each recess  in order to improve the deformation ability of the outer layer .</p><p>The sheath  comprises a relatively hard material that has a relatively higher resistance to deformation. On impact, the forces are absorbed through the hard outer layer  deforming and compressing the inner layer wherein said depression controls the movement of the first surface towards the second. The hard outer layer , elastically deforms in a controlled and restricted manner, which allows the fixing member  to compress to form an ovular, egg-like shape. The deformation or compression forces are distributed through the fixing member  radially and circumferentially so that the deformation is achieved more uniformly around the fixing member  and the force is not solely transferred through one side or face of the fixing member . In this embodiment, the soft inner core  is surrounding by the outer layer  which acts like a sleeve to wrap the core .</p><p>Figure  shows the fixing member  located within a tube  in order to hold the first part  of the impact barrier within the second part  of the impact barrier. Here, the fixing member  is slotted between the first part  and the tube  so that the first side  of the fixing member acts against the first part  of the impact barrier and the second side  of the fixing member  acts against the second part  of the impact barrier. On impact, the first part  is pulled from the second part  which causes the second side  of the fixing member  to deform. After the impact, if the material is resilient, the fixing member  returns to its original location. The second side  of the fixing member  acts longitudinally across the tube  so that the first part  and second part  are not easily detached from the tube . The fixing member  is press fitted so that when the impact barrier recoils after the impact, the fixing member  does not fall out or move away from its original position. It is appreciated that an end stop may be applied to the fixing member  in order to prevent any dislodging ordownward movement.</p><p>Referring to Figure , a foot plate  is shown by way of example to illustrate a further exemplary embodiment. It will however be appreciated that the connection may apply equally to a post and rail connection. The foot plate  assembled to a post  is shown in Figures  and . A fixing such as an elongate pin secures the post to the footplate, wherein the foot plate has been inserted into the post. In the previous embodiments, the pin was in contact with an area of reduced resistance to deformation only to one side of the shear force acting on the pin. This provides good control of lateral movement, but during impact often a bending moment is also created. Whilst the previous embodiments allowed the post to pivot, the pivot point is not at a centre of the post. Consequently it is advantageous as shown to provide an area of reduced resistance to deformation on both sides of the pin. As shown, the pin therefore extends through an aperture as before in the post and maintain a static relationship with the post. The pin extends through the foot plate. Slots extend either side of the pin in which the softer material is placed as herein described. Consequently as the shearing force causes the pin to lift on one side, the same shearing force causes the other side of the pin to move downwardly. The pin therefore pivots towards a centre of the footplate .</p><p>In the Figures the pin  is formed in two parts. The two parts remain connected by a ball. This allows a second pin to be inserted through the footplate at an angle but on the same plane as the first pin. Consequently, the post is able to pivot due to the compression of a soft area in two directions.</p><p>Referring back to Figure , the foot plate therefore comprises a body  including ground anchor fixing points  so that the foot plate can be securely fastened to the ground. The body includes a generally cylindrical part that up stands from a base and is inserted into the post. Once inserted, pins  are inserted through the apertures on the post, the slots in the base plate and so that parts of the pins extend between the post and base plate at four positions. Slots within the base plate are filled with a softer material so as to absorb energy during impact.</p><p>As shown in Figure , a predominantly plastic barrier is therefore provided having adequate strength between the footplate and post and rail and post to withstand and provide protection against impacts. The barriers are aesthetically pleasing as seamless designs can be utilised wherein the rail and posts are substantially equally sized. Here a collar  is formed on the connector so that square end posts can be used without creating gaps in the seamless appearance.</p><p>The foregoing embodiments have been described in relation to an impact barrier. Such barriers are designed to withstand the dynamic forces generated by an impact. Often, such barriers have to conform to specific standards set by the rules, regulations and best practices of each country. For instance, rules governing amounts of deflection acceptable from given loads. However, it will be appreciated that the barrier system described herein may also be adaptable to other barrier systems. For instance, safety barriers other than impact barriers such as balustrading that is designed to withstand static loading. Here static loading may be applied during a person leaning against the barrier. The barrier system offers a safety barrier having the advantages outlined above such as ease of assembly, ease of replacement, better force distribution, and common size post and rail giving seamless joins. Moreover, there are other barriers such as segregation barriers and partition barriers where the barrier system described herein can be adapted to produce advantageous affects.</p><p>Although a few preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications might be made without departing from the scope of the invention, as defined in the appended claims.</p></description>

The saddle  also includes a seat  on the saddle body .</p><p>The saddle body  comprises a pair of downwardly extending flaps , either side of the torso of the horse, and an upper part  which is intended to be arranged on the back of the horse.</p><p>The saddle body  comprises first and second body portions , . Each of the first and second body portions ,  have respective first and second securing edge regions , each of which provides a respective edge . The first and second body portions ,  are secured to each other at the securing edge regions . The first edge region  of the first body portion  is skived or bevelled on the upper surface thereof. The second edge region  of the second body portion  is skived or bevelled on the lower surface thereof.</p><p>In Figure , the first body portion  is shown arranged flat, prior to being secured to the second body portion . As can be seen, the edges  are inwardly curved. The first edge region  is delimited in Figure  by a broken line.</p><p>The first and second body portions ,  are secured to each other along the respective first and second edge regions . The inwardly curved edges  have the effect that, when the first and second body portions ,  are secured to each other at the respective first and second edge regions , they form an overlapping seam .</p><p>The inwardly curved edges  cause the front and rear of the saddle body  to rise relative to the centre of the seam . Thus, the saddle body  so formed conforms to the shape of the back of a horse.</p><p>In order to secure the edge regions  of the first and second body portions ,  to each other, the edge region  of the first body portion  is arranged to overlie the edge region  of the second body portion at the seam  (see Figure ), and then the edge regions  are stitched to each other by lacing through the edge regions  of the first and second body portions ,  as shown by the lacing or stitching  in Figure , which comprises a zigzag lacing formation along the overlain edge regions  of the first and second body portions , . The lacing extends over the edge  of each of the first and second edge regions , and through apertures A defined in the first and second body portions ,  at the edge regions .</p><p>Referring to Figure , the girth securing assembly  is attached to the saddle body  as described below. The girth securing assembly  comprises an elongate support strap  having first and second end regions , .</p><p>The first and second end regions ,  are fixedly attached to the saddle body  by stitching  through first and second fixings A, A respectively.

The third fixing A is also in the form of oblong leather cover piece.</p><p>First and second mounting members in the form of first and second lower D rings ,  are provided at a region of the saddle body lower than the upper D ring . The support strap  extends through the first and second lower D rings , . Thus, the upper D ring  and the first and second lower D rings ,  allow the support strap  to slide therethrough, thereby accommodating the movement of the horse.</p><p>The saddle includes first and second girth straps ,  which are secured respectively to the first and second lower D rings ,  by stitching .</p><p>Although the mounting members have been described herein as being in the form of D rings, it will be appreciated that the mounting members could be in the form of rings of rectangular shape, or of other suitable shape.</p><p>The above described arrangement of the girth securing assembly  has the advantage that the forces from the girth are more even along the back of the horse.</p><p>The ability of the straps to slide through the upper D ring  and the first and second lower D rings ,  allows the force on the girth to be equalised between the three points at which the support strap  is secured to the saddle body .</p><p>Referring to Figure , the stirrup hanger assembly  is also secured to the saddle body , for example by stitching. The stirrup hanger assembly  comprises a generally flat base  formed of a flexible material, such as leather.</p><p>The stirrup hanger assembly  comprises a stirrup carrier arrangement  secured to the base .</p><p>The stirrup carrier arrangement  comprises a stirrup holding member  which has a first portion  to receive the stirrups, and a second portion  to allow it to be secured to a securing strap . The stirrup carrier arrangement further includes a stop member  to prevent or restrict movement of the stirrup holding member .</p><p>The securing strap  comprises first and second securing members , . The securing strap  is provided to secure the stirrup carrier arrangement  to the base .</p><p>The securing strap  is folded over itself at a fold  in the strap  to provide the first and second securing member  ,  , so that the fold  of the elongate strap  provides an apex for the first and second securing members , , at which the stirrup holding member  is secured.</p><p>The first and second securing members ,  extend at an acute angle from the fold .</p><p>As can be seen from figure , the stirrup hanger assembly comprises a pair of stirrup carrier arrangements  arranged on the base .</p><p>In figure , the base  is formed in two pieces, A, B which are secured to one another. This has the advantage of allowing the base to be secured to the saddle body  across the seam .</p><p>Figure  shows a cushioning arrangement  which is provided on the underside of the saddle body . The cushioning arrangement  comprises a foam rubber cushioning member  (shown in broken lines) held within a cover  formed of a suitable flexible material, such as leather. The cushioning member may be formed of a suitable resilient material, such as expanded polyurethane.</p><p>The cushioning arrangement  is generally L shaped having two arms A and B.

An example of a suitable material is high density polyethylene.</p><p>Thus, in this embodiment, the load created by the girth and the stirrups is spread along the load spreading member , thereby alleviating or preventing pressure points.</p><p>A padding member  (also shown in broken lines in Figure ) is provided at the rear of the cushioning arrangement . The padding member  can be formed of a suitable resilient material, such as expanded polyurethane.</p><p>The saddle  includes two cushioning arrangements , each being attached on the underside of a respective body portion ,  of the saddle body .</p><p>Referring to Figures  and , the seat  is shown, which is formed as a one-piece seat member , having a pommel  and a cantle . The seat  is of a shape that conforms to the traditional shape of a saddle, thereby allowing correct rider posture. The seat member  may be formed of a suitable resilient material, such as expanded polyurethane.</p><p>The seat  includes a sleeve , which is formed of leather or other similar material, and is provided to secure the seat  to the saddle body.</p><p>The seat member  is arranged in the sleeve , and the sleeve  is glued to the seat member .

       "<description lang=\"en\" load-source=\"lhip\" data-format=\"original\"><p>Ring Cam and Fluid-Working Machine Including Ring Cam</p><p>Field of the invention</p><p>The invention relates to a ring cam for a fluid-working machine. The invention is of especial relevance in applications where ring cams are subjected to particularly large forces in use, and in particular to ring cams for large fluid-working machines, for example for use in the nacelle of a wind turbine.</p><p>Background to the Invention</p><p>Fluid-working machines include fluid-driven and/or fluid-driving machines, such as pumps, motors, and machines which can function as either a pump or as a motor in different operating modes.</p><p>When a fluid-working machine operates as a pump, a low pressure manifold typically acts as a net source of a working fluid and a high pressure manifold typically acts as a net sink for a working fluid. When a fluid-working machine operates as a motor, a high pressure manifold typically acts as a net source of a working fluid and a low pressure manifold typically acts as a net sink for a working fluid. Within this description and the appended claims, the terms “high pressure” and “low pressure” are relative, and depend on the particular application. In some embodiments, low pressure working fluid may be at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure, and may be several times atmospheric pressure. However, in all cases, low pressure working fluid will be at a lower pressure than high pressure working fluid. A fluidworking machine may have more than one low pressure manifold and more than one high pressure manifold.</p><p>Large displacement ring cam fluid-working machines (i.e. fluid-working machines having a large rotating annular cam driving a plurality of radial pistons arranged around the cam, with each piston typically reciprocating multiple times per cam revolution) are known and are proposed for use in renewable energy applications in which there is a low speed rotating input but a relatively high speed electrical generator (Rampen, Taylor &amp; Riddoch, Gearless transmissions for wind turbines, DEWEK, Bremen, Dec. ). Ring cam fluid-working machines typically have a plurality of rollers rolling on a wave shaped cam and operatively connected to pistons. Each piston is slideably engaged in a cylinder, the cylinder and piston together defining a working chamber containing working fluid, in communication via one or more valves with high and low pressure manifolds. The pistons are each operable to undergo reciprocating motion within the cylinder so as to vary the working chamber volume, when the ring cam rotates, such that a cycle of working chamber volume is executed, and during which working fluid may be displaced.</p><p>Ring cam fluid-working machines may be configured so that the pistons and cylinders are located inside the ring cam, the ring cam having an inward facing working surface, or may be configured so that the ring cam has an outward facing working surface and is located inside the pistons and cylinders. Indeed, ring cam fluid-working machines of either configuration are also known in which either the ring cam rotates, or the pistons and cylinders rotate. It is also possible for the ring cam to have both inward and outward facing working surfaces where the ring cam is located between inner and outer rings of pistons and cylinders. It is even possible for the pistons and cylinders to be aligned roughly parallel with the axis of rotation, and for the ring cam to have one or more axially facing working surfaces.</p><p>Ring cam pumps driving relatively small hydraulic motors have been proposed as robust variable speed transmissions, for example, for use in wind turbine generators, or tidal stream and gravity-fed hydroelectric generators.</p><p>Multi-cylinder fluid-working machines, including ring cam fluid-working machines, may be variable displacement fluid-working machines (either pumps or motors, or machines operable as either pumps or motors), wherein each working chamber is selectable to execute an active (or part-active) cycle of working chamber volume in which there is a net displacement of working fluid, or an idle cycle in which there is substantially no net displacement of working fluid, by the working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume, for regulating the time-averaged net displacement of fluid from the low pressure manifold to the high pressure manifold or vice versa.</p><p>Large ring cam machines are difficult and expensive to repair, requiring disassembly of the whole body to repair even one working chamber. This may be particularly expensive in renewable energy applications because a heavy fluid-working machine must be moved from an inaccessible location (for example the nacelle of a wind turbine) requiring concomitantly large and costly transportation equipment (e.g. a crane). It is therefore desirable for such large scale fluid-working machines to be repairable in situ, so as to reduce or obviate the requirement for transportation of large components.</p><p>Furthermore, large fluid-working machines (such as those suitable for renewable energy generation) are typically subject to particularly high internal forces and pressures. For example, the pressure of the high (and indeed low pressure) working fluid of a large scale ring cam fluid-working machine, of a size suitable for a wind turbine, is particularly high. Consequently the forces received by the ring cam from the rollers are also high, and it is known for the ring cam working surfaces to degrade. It has been proposed to assemble large scale ring cams from a number of segments, and it is known for excessive wear to occur to the roller and to the working surface due to discontinuities which appear on the working surface under pressure of a roller at the interface between segments. Additionally, the weight of the rotating parts themselves may lead to excessive ring cam wear.</p><p>Accordingly, there remains a need for a fluid-working machine and a ring cam of modular construction for a radial fluid-working machine, of minimum weight and having extended working lifetime.</p><p>Summary of the invention</p><p>The terms “leading” or “trailing” edge (or end or other feature) of a part of a ring cam, or segment thereof, are expressed herein in relation to the direction of rotation of the ring cam in relation to the pistons, typically due to rotation of the ring cam but in some embodiments due to rotation of a housing on which the pistons are mounted. In some embodiments, the relative rotation of the ring cam and the pistons may be in either sense (for example the sense of rotation of a given fluid working machine may be reversed at certain times during operation or maintenance) and the leading and trailing edges or other features are defined in relation to one of the senses of rotation. Reference to reciprocating motion of at least one piston being coupled to rotation of the ring cam relative to the at least one piston include the possibilities that either the ring cam rotates, or the at least one piston rotates, or both rotate but at unequal rates. In all cases rotation is about an axis through the centre of the ring cam.</p><p>According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a ring cam for a fluidworking machine having at least one piston, the ring cam comprising at least two segments; each said segment having a leading cooperating formation at a leading region, and a trailing cooperating formation at a trailing region; each leading cooperating formation in cooperative engagement with a said trailing cooperating formation at an interlocking region; each said segment having a piston facing surface, the piston facing surfaces together defining a (typically, multi-lobe) cam working surface for operative engagement with the at least one piston by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston, e.g. a piston shoe, or more typically a roller) so as to couple reciprocating motion of the at least one piston to rotation of the ring cam relative to the at least one piston; each said leading and trailing cooperating formation having a portion of the piston facing surface;</p><p>characterised in that each leading cooperating formation has a piston facing surface which forms part of the working surface at a trailing region of the leading cooperating formation and is recessed from the working surface at the leading region of the leading cooperating formation, across the interlocking region, and each trailing cooperating formation has a piston facing surface which forms part of the working surface at a leading region of the trailing cooperating formation and is recessed from the working surface at the trailing region of the trailing cooperating formation, across the interlocking region.</p><p>The invention also extends in a second aspect to a piston fluid-working machine comprising a ring cam according to the first aspect of the action, and at least one piston (typically a plurality of pistons) operatively engaging with the ring cam working surface such that reciprocating motion of the at least one piston is coupled to rotation of the ring cam relative to the at least one piston.</p><p>The invention also extends to a method of operating a fluid-working machine having a ring cam according to the first aspect, and at least one piston coupled to the ring cam by way of a cam engaging element, the method comprising causing relative rotation of the ring cam and the at least one piston such that the at least one cam engaging element passes smoothly from the leading cooperating formation of a first segment to the trailing cooperating formation of a second segment.</p><p>Typically, the or each piston operatively engages with the ring cam by way of a cam engaging element, which is typically a roller.</p><p>In known segmented ring cams, the working surface of one ring cam segment is intended to be aligned with and contact the working surface of an adjacent ring cam segment, such that the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, move smoothly between the ring cam segments. However, in practice, there will often be significant mismatches between adjacent working surfaces. Mismatches may be present on installation, or develop through wear, or be created transiently consequent to forces within the fluid working machine in use (for example resulting from the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, applying force to the cams). Thus, there will be discontinuities leading not only to noise, but to wear on the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, or on the edges of the working surfaces of the ring cam segments.</p><p>However, in the ring cam of the present invention, adjacent segments have interlocking cooperating formations, each of which has a piston facing surface which forms part of the working surface at one end, and is recessed from the working surface at the other end. There will be a location within the interlocking zone where a cam engaging element would contact both cooperating formations simultaneously. Thus, a roller (in rolling engagement with the ring cam), or other cam engaging element, will be handed over smoothly from one segment to the next segment, by contacting the working surface of the leading cooperating formation of the first segment, and then simultaneously contacting the working surface of the leading cooperating formation of the first segment and the trailing cooperating formation of the second segment, and then contacting only the working surface of the second segment. If there are any small mismatches in the alignment of the adjacent segments, this process will happen a little sooner or earlier. Furthermore, the exact position of this location may depend on manufacturing tolerances and wear. However, there should not be a discontinuity such as would be found with slightly mismatched parallel working surfaces. Thus, smooth handover, minimising wear, can be accomplished despite manufacturing tolerances and wear in use. The cooperating formations are typically recessed from the working surface gradually along their length.</p><p>Typically the piston facing surface at the leading region of the leading cooperating formation, and the piston facing surface at the trailing region of the trailing cooperating formation, are recessed from the working surface by at least .mm, .mm or mm in at least part of the interlocking region.</p><p>Typically, each cooperating formation comprises a tongue. Typically, each leading cooperating formation comprises a leading tongue, having a piston facing surface which forms part of the working surface at a trailing edge of the leading tongue, and which is recessed from the working surface at the leading region of the leading tongue, across the interlocking region. Typically also, each trailing cooperating formation comprises a trailing tongue, having a piston facing surface which forms part of the working surface at a leading edge of the trailing tongue, and which is recessed from the working surface at the trailing region of the trailing tongue, across the interlocking region. A cooperating formation may have a plurality of tongues. A cooperating formation may comprise first and second tongues defining a groove therebetween.</p><p>By the interlocking region, we refer to a region where cooperating formations (e.g. tongues) are adjacent each other, orthogonal to the direction in which rollers, or other cam engaging elements, move along the working surface in use. Thus, the cam engaging elements will extend over both cooperating formations in the interlocking region for a period of time as they are handed over from one segment to the next adjacent segment.</p><p>Typically, a plurality of pistons are arranged either outside the ring cam (for an outward facing ring cam), or inside the ring (for an inward facing ring cam), or, in some embodiments both (for a ring cam having both inward facing and outward facing working surfaces). Thus, the fluid-working machine is typically a radial piston fluid-working machine. However, a plurality of pistons may be arranged generally parallel to the axis of rotation of the ring cam. The plurality of pistons are typically radially arranged around the ring cam, and usually equally spaced.</p><p>Preferably, each piston is associated with a working chamber of volume which varies cyclically with reciprocating movement of the piston. Preferably, each piston is slidably mounted within a cylinder, such that a working chamber is defined between the cylinder and piston. Typically, the fluid-working machine comprises a body and the or each cylinder may be formed in the body. For example, the body may comprise or consist of a cylinder block. In some embodiments, the or each cylinder, or the or each piston, may be articulated (typically via a spherical bearing). The or each piston may be restrained within the body.</p><p>The volume of the working chamber varies cyclically with rotation of the ring cam. The fluid-working machine comprises a low pressure manifold and a high-pressure manifold, and a plurality of valves for regulating the flow of fluid between each working chamber and the low pressure and high-pressure manifold. Typically, at least one said valve associated with each working chamber is an electronically controlled valve. The fluid-working machine comprises a controller operable to control one or more said electronically controlled valves, on each cycle of working chamber volume and in phased relation to cycles working chamber volume, to select the net volume of working fluid displaced by each working chamber on each volume cycle.</p><p>Typically, each roller, or other cam engaging element, is biased against the ring cam working surface. For example, each roller, or other cam engaging element, may be biased against the working surface by an elastic member, such as a spring. Typically the elastic member biases each piston against each roller, or other cam engaging element, thereby biasing said roller (or other cam engaging element) against the working surface. Alternatively, or in addition, each roller (or other cam engaging element) and/or each piston, is biased against the working surface by fluid pressure from within the respective working chamber, throughout a part or all of a cycle of working chamber volume. Typically, fluid from within the respective working chamber is also in direct communication with each roller, or other cam engaging element, thereby to bias said roller, or other cam engaging element, against the working surface, and further to separate the roller, or other cam engaging element, from the piston. For example, each said piston may define a passageway extending from the working chamber and into fluid communication with the roller and the adjacent surface of the piston, so that high pressure fluid pools between the piston and the roller, and functions as a self-balancing fluid bearing.</p><p>In practice, the force exerted on each roller, or other cam engaging element, can be substantial. This force varies periodically during cycles of working chamber volume (and in some embodiments depends on the volume of fluid to be displaced by the working chamber on a particular cycle of working chamber volume selected by the controller). In order to reduce wear, it may be that the machine is configured, or operable, such that the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, bear on the interlocking regions when the respective working chamber is in direct fluid communication with the low pressure manifold and/or isolated from the high pressure manifold.</p><p>The fluid-working machine may be configured (or operable) such that the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, do not bear on the interlocking regions when the respective working chamber is contracting (for example in embodiments where the fluid-working machine is a pump). The fluid working machine may be configured (or operable) such that the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, do not bear on the interlocking regions when the respective working chamber is expanding (for example, in embodiments where the fluid-working machine is a motor). The fluid-working machine may be configured such that, when rotation is in a first direction, the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, do not bear on the interlocking regions when the respective working chamber is contracting, and when rotation is in a second direction, the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, do not bear on the interlocking regions when the respective working chamber is expanding (for example, in embodiments where the fluid-working machine is a pump/motor operable as a pump in a first direction of rotation and as a motor in a second direction of rotation).</p><p>In some embodiments the roller, or other cam engaging element, of a working chamber does not bear on an interlocking region every cycle(for example, the roller or other cam engaging element may bear on an interlocking region during only every second or only every third cycle, or only every more than two, or three or more cycles) of working chamber volume.</p><p>Accordingly, in embodiments wherein the fluid-working machine is operable as both a pump and a motor in a first direction of rotation, the fluid-working machine may be configured, or operable, such that in the first direction of rotation, each cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region when the respective working chamber is contracting, each said working chamber operable to execute a pumping cycle during every cycle of working chamber volume, and each said working chamber operable to execute a motoring cycle during cycles of working chamber volume in which the cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region (every second cycle, or every third cycle, or only every more than two, or three or more cycles, of working chamber volume, as the case may be.</p><p>In some embodiments, the fluid-working machine is operable as both a pump and a motor in a first direction of rotation and each cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region only when the respective working chamber is expanding, each said working chamber operable to execute a motoring cycle during every cycle of working chamber volume, and each said working chamber operable to execute a pumping cycle during cycles of working chamber volume in which the cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region.</p><p>The fluid-working machine may be operable as a motor in a first direction of rotation, and as a pump in a second direction of rotation, in the first direction of rotation each cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region when the respective working chamber is expanding, and in the second direction of rotation, each cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region when the respective working chamber is contracting.</p><p>Thus, when a roller or other cam engaging element bears on an interlocking region, the fluid pressure in the working chamber is limited, in comparison to the fluid pressure in the working chamber when the cam engaging element bears upon another region of the working surface (i.e. another region of the working surface not comprising an interlocking region or other discontinuity).</p><p>The fluid-working machine may be configured (or operable) such that the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, bear on the interlocking regions only when the respective working chamber is expanding (for example in embodiments where the fluid-working machine is a pump). The fluid working machine may be configured such that the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, bear on the interlocking regions only when the respective working chamber is contracting (for example, in embodiments where the fluid-working machine is a motor).</p><p>Accordingly, in embodiments wherein the fluid-working machine is operable as both a pump and a motor in a first direction of rotation, the fluid-working machine may be configured, or operable, such that in the first direction of rotation, each cam engaging element bears on an interlocking region only when the respective working chamber is expanding, each said working chamber operable to execute a pumping cycle during every cycle of working chamber volume, and each said working chamber operable to execute a motoring cycle during cycles of working chamber volume in which the cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region (every second cycle, or every third cycle, or only every more than two, or three or more cycles, of working chamber volume, as the case may be.</p><p>In some embodiments, the fluid-working machine is operable as both a pump and a motor in a first direction of rotation and each cam engaging element bears on an interlocking region only when the respective working chamber is contracting, each said working chamber operable to execute a motoring cycle during every cycle of working chamber volume, and each said working chamber operable to execute a pumping cycle during cycles of working chamber volume in which the cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region.</p><p>The fluid-working machine may be operable as a motor in a first direction of rotation, and as a pump in a second direction of rotation, in the first direction of rotation each cam engaging element bearing on an interlocking region only when the respective working chamber is contracting, and in the second direction of rotation, each cam engaging element bearing on an interlocking region only when the respective working chamber is expanding.</p><p>Thus, when a roller or other cam engaging element bears on an interlocking region, the fluid pressure in the working chamber is limited, in comparison to the fluid pressure in the working chamber when the cam engaging element bears upon another region of the working surface (i.e. another region of the working surface not comprising an interlocking region or other discontinuity).</p><p>Fluid-working machines may be operable to function as a pump or a motor (in one or both directions of rotation). Fluid-working machines (for example wind turbines) may function for the substantial majority of time as a pump, but also be operable as a motor, so as to enable the turbine blades (or other rotating apparatus) to be driven to a desired orientation during maintenance. It may be advantageous in some applications for a fluid-working machine to be operable as both a pump and a motor in a given direction of rotation. For example, fluid-working machines (such as wind turbines) which function as a pump for the majority of the time (and the or each cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region when the working chamber is contracting) may thus advantageously be operable on only some cycles of working chamber volume (i.e. when the or each cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region) as a motor so as to position the machine. For example, fluidworking machines (such as wind turbines) which function as a pump for the majority of the time (and the or each cam engaging element does not bear on an interlocking region when the working chamber is contracting) may thus advantageously be operable for a minority of the time as a motor (i.e. when the or each cam engaging element bears on an interlocking region when the working chamber is expanding) so as to position the machine.</p><p>In some embodiments (for example wherein each said working chamber is selectable on a cycle by cycle basis to execute an active cycle or an idle cycle and/or selectable to execute a pumping cycle or a motoring cycle, or wherein the fluid-working machine is configured to conduct a sequence of active cycles and idle cycles, or pumping cycles and motoring cycles in respective first and second directions of rotation) the fluid-working machine is operable (or configured), to limit the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber (in comparison to the fluid pressure in the working chamber when the cam engaging element bears upon another region of the working surface) when the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, bear on an interlocking region (in comparison to the fluid pressure in the working chamber when the cam engaging element bears upon another region of the working surface). Preferably the fluid pressure is limited to a pressure substantially lower than the maximum pressure during a typical active cycle of working chamber volume. For example, the may be limited to less than  Bar,  Bar or  Bar. The pressure may be limited to less than %, or less than %, of the maximum rated operating pressure of the working chamber, or the maximum pressure during a typical active cycle of working chamber volume.</p><p>Preferably the pressure is limited when the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, bear on an interlocking region by the controller selecting the net volume of working fluid to be displaced by the said working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume. The net volume of working fluid displaced by a working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume may be selected in advance of the respective cycle of working chamber volume.</p><p>It may be that the net volume of fluid to be displaced by a said working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume (i.e. an active, idle, motoring or pumping cycle), is selected or selectable responsive to the pressure in the high pressure manifold and/or the position of each said roller (or other cam engaging element) in relation to each said interlocking region, so as to limit the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber.</p><p>For example, the pressure in the high pressure manifold of a fluid working machine of a wind turbine may vary depending on wind speed.</p><p>In some embodiments, the controller is operable to control the (by opening, closing or prevention of the opening or closing) one or more electronically controlled valves (between a said working chamber and the high and/or low pressure manifolds) to select a volume of working fluid to be displaced, or to prevent displacement of working fluid, by a said working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume, when the associated roller, or other cam engaging element, bears on an interlocking region, to thereby limit the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber when the roller, or other cam engaging element, bears on an interlocking region.</p><p>In some embodiments, each said working chamber is operable to execute a part active cycle, in which there is a net displacement of a volume of fluid which is less than the maximum volume of fluid that the working chamber is operable to displace. Accordingly, the controller may be operable to control the one or more electronically controlled valves to select a part active cycle of a said working chamber when the associated roller, or other cam engaging element, bears on an interlocking region, to thereby limit the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber during that portion of said cycle of working chamber volume when the roller, or other cam engaging element, bears on an interlocking region.</p><p>The working surface may comprise further discontinuities and the fluid-working machine may be operable to limit the working-fluid pressure in the said working chamber when the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, bear on a discontinuity.</p><p>Accordingly, the method may comprise selecting, on a cycle by cycle basis, one or more of an active pumping cycle and active motoring cycle or an idle cycle, of one or more of the said working chambers, so as to limit the pressure in one or more of working chambers, when a cam engaging element bears on an interlocking region (or other discontinuity in the working surface). The method may comprise causing the controller to select an active pumping cycle and active motoring cycle or an idle cycle, of one or more of the said working chambers.</p><p>It may be that the axis of movement of each piston is coplanar with the ring cam, but does not extend directly radially from a centre axis of the ring cam. Instead, the axis of movement of each piston is preferably canted, i.e. does not extend directly away from the centre axis of the ring cam. This reduces shearing forces acting on the pistons slidably mounted within cylinders.</p><p>Typically, the working surface of the ring cam is wavelike (defining at least one and typically a plurality of waves). The waves may be sinusoidal, although there is typically some departure from sinusoidal form. Some or all segments may have a piston facing surface defining a portion of wave. In some embodiments, one or more of the or each said segment comprises a piston facing surface defining more than one wave, or a plurality of waves. Thus, the roller, or other cam engaging element, of a working chamber does not bear on an interlocking region every cycle of working chamber volume and may bear on an interlocking region only every more than one cycle of working chamber volume (which may be an integer or non-integer number cycles of working chamber volume). The roller, or other cam engaging element, of a working chamber may bear on an interlocking region only every two (or more than two) cycles of working chamber volume. Thus some or all segments may comprise more than one crest of the wavelike surface. Some or all segments may comprise more than one trough of the wavelike surface. The segments forming a ring cam may all be the same as each other, or there may be two or more shapes of segment forming the ring cam.</p><p>The ring cam may be mounted on a rotatable shaft. The rotatable shaft may be hollow. It may be that the ring cam rotates and the at least one piston remain in place. It may be that the ring cam is stationary and the least one piston rotates relative to the ring cam. It may be that, both the ring cam and the at least one piston may rotate, but with different rates or directions of rotation, such that there is relative rotation between the ring cam and the at least one piston.</p><p>Preferably, the most leading tip of the leading cooperating formation of a segment, or the most trailing region of the trailing cooperating formation of a segment, are smooth. By avoiding sharp edges, wear can be reduced.</p><p>Preferably, some or all segments comprise a slip-resisting formation, to resist slip of the segment relative to a cam segment support. For example, one or more segments may comprise a spline or groove to fit into a cooperating groove or spline of a cam segment support, or a groove to receive a keying member which also fits into a groove on a cam segment support. Preferably the cam segment support comprises the rotatable shaft.</p><p>Preferably, the piston facing surfaces of the cooperating formations of adjacent segments which engage in an interlocking region, cross at an angle of less than .° (but typically greater than .°).</p><p>Thus, the invention extends in a third aspect to a ring cam for a fluid-working machine having at least one piston, the ring cam comprising at least two segments; each said segment having a leading cooperating formation at a leading region, and a trailing cooperating formation at a trailing region; each leading cooperating formation in cooperative engagement with a said trailing cooperating formation at an interlocking region; each said segment having a piston facing surface, the piston facing surfaces together defining a (typically, multi-lobe) cam working surface for operative engagement with the at least one piston (typically by way of a cam engaging element, such as a roller) so as to couple reciprocating motion of the at least one piston to rotation of the ring cam or the at least one piston relative to the other; characterised in that the piston facing surfaces of the cooperating formations of adjacent segments which engage in an interlocking region cross at an angle of less than .° (but typically greater than .°).</p><p>Because the piston facing surfaces of cooperating formations of adjacent segments which engage in an interlocking region cross at an angle of less than .°, a roller, mounted to a piston, rolling from one segment to an adjacent segment, will briefly have a point of contact with the working surface of each of the two adjacent segments, thereby transferring force gradually from one segment to the next segment. Even if there is a slight mismatch between the piston facing surfaces of adjacent pistons, a roller may still pass over the resulting discontinuity if it is small relative to the curvature of the ring cam and the said angle.</p><p>By crossing at an angle, we refer to the angle at which a plane which is coplanar with the piston facing surface of a cooperating formation at an interlocking region and a plane which is coplanar with the piston facing surface of an adjacent cooperating formation intersect.</p><p>The invention also extends in a fourth aspect to a fluid-working machine comprising a ring cam according to the third aspect of the invention, and at least one piston (typically a plurality of pistons), the at least one piston coupled to a roller, the at least one roller in rolling engagement with the ring cam working surface such that reciprocating motion of the at least one piston is coupled to rotation of the ring cam relative to the at least one piston.</p><p>The invention extends in a fifth aspect to a ring cam for a fluid-working machine having at least one piston, the ring cam comprising at least two segments; said segments having a piston facing surface, the piston facing surfaces together defining a (typically multi-lobe) cam working surface for operative engagement with the at least one piston by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston, e.g. a piston shoe, or more typically a roller) so as to couple reciprocating motion of the at least one piston to rotation of the ring cam relative to the at least one piston characterised in that the piston facing surface of each segment is held in compression.</p><p>Thus, when forces from the pistons (coupled through cam engaging elements such as rollers or piston shoes) bear on the piston facing surface of each segment, the resulting tensile stress is partially or fully cancelled out by the compression of the piston facing surface of the segment, reducing or avoiding tensile stresses which could otherwise reduce the working life of the segment. The segment is typically made from metal, such as steel, which is stronger in compression than in tension.</p><p>Preferably the piston facing surface is held in tangential (also known as hoop) compression. By tangential compression is meant that the piston facing surface of each segment is compressed in the direction tangential to (and around) the piston facing surface. Preferably the compression of the piston facing surface is greater than  MPa,  MPa or  MPa, in the direction tangential to the piston facing surface.</p><p>In practice, as well as the piston facing surface of each segment, at least a region adjacent the surface of each segment will be held in compression. Typically, a compressed region extends into the segment from the piston facing surface, wherein the tangential compression is preferably greater than  MPa,  MPa or  MPa.</p><p>For example, tangentially compressive forces may be present in the segment to a depth of greater than  mm,  mm or  mm from the piston facing surface.</p><p>By being held in compression, we refer to there being compressive strain in the absence of other forces, such as forces from a piston. Thus, the segments are elastically deformed. Typically, the or each segment would adopt a different shape were it not held in compression. Thus, the segment is typically retained such that at least the piston facing surface is held in compression, and typically tangential compression, by one or more fixtures. The one or more fixtures may be releasable, to enable the segments to be removed. For example, the segments may be individually removable to enable them to be tested, maintained or replaced.</p><p>Typically each said segment has an inherent curvature which the segment would adopt without external forces and each said segment is held with a different curvature, thereby holding the piston facing surface of each segment in compression, and typically tangential compression. By the inherent curvature we refer to the curvature which the segment would adopt if there were no external forces acting on it, such as forces arising from pistons or from the segment being held under elastic deformation by one or more fixtures.</p><p>Typically, the ring cam comprises a cam segment support, such as a drum, and each segment is fixed to the cam segment support by one or more fixtures. Typically, each segment has a support facing surface opposite the piston facing surface.</p><p>It may be that each segment comprises one or more through bores extending between the support facing surface and piston facing surface for receiving one or more fixtures, such as bolts, to retain the segment on the cam segment support, with the piston facing surface under compression. Thus, the piston facing surface of each segment is typically perforated by the through bores. Each segment may comprise indentations in the side of the segment, extending from the piston facing surface to the one or more fixtures.</p><p>The ring cam may have an outward facing working surface for operative engagement with pistons radially outward of the ring cam, wherein each said segment is retained with a lesser curvature than its inherent curvature. Thus, the cam segment support may define a first radius of curvature and each segment may have an inherent curvature with a second radius of curvature, wherein the first radius of curvature is greater than the second radius of curvature. The first radius of curvature may be defined by the configuration of segment retaining formations (such as bolt holes) on the cam segment support (which need not extend continuously between the segment retaining formations). Each segment may be retained, with the piston facing surface in compression, by one or more bolts extending through said through bores to the cam segment support. Preferably the first radius of curvature is at least .% or . % greater than the second radius of curvature and the first radius of curvature may be between .% and .%, or in some embodiments between .% and .%, greater than the second radius of curvature.</p><p>The ring cam may have an inward facing working surface for operative engagement with pistons radially inward of the ring cam, wherein each said segment is retained with a greater curvature than its inherent curvature. Thus, the cam segment support may define a first radius of curvature and each segment may have an inherent curvature with a second radius of curvature, wherein the first radius of curvature is less than the second radius of curvature. The first radius of curvature may be defined by the configuration of segment retaining formations (such as bolt holes) on the cam segment support which need not extend continuously between the segment retaining formations. Each segment may be retained, with the piston facing surface in compression, by one or more bolts extending through said through bores (or indentations) to the cam segment support. Preferably the first radius of curvature is at least .% or .% less than the second radius of curvature and the first radius of curvature may be between .% and .%, or in some embodiments between .% and .%, greater than the second radius of curvature.</p><p>Each said segment may comprise one or more compressible zones beneath the piston facing surface (closer, and typically much closer, to the piston facing surface than the support engaging surface), the compressible zones comprising a medium having greater compressibility than the surrounding material of the segment.</p><p>The zones may extend partially or entirely across the segment (for example, substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the ring cam). The compressible zones may be holes or voids in the material of said segments, for example through-bores extending between opposite sides of the segment. The compressible zones may comprise any other suitable compressible medium.</p><p>Each said segment may comprise a plurality of compressible zones.</p><p>Compressible zones advantageously facilitate the generation of compression in the said piston facing surfaces. The compressible zones may enable the generation of greater tangential compression for a given amount of force exerted by the fixtures.</p><p>The invention extends in an seventh aspect to a fluid-working machine comprising a ring cam according to the sixth aspect of the invention, and at least one piston (typically a plurality of pistons) operatively engaging with the ring cam working surface by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston or e.g. a roller) such that reciprocating motion of the at least one piston is coupled to rotation of the ring cam relative to the at least one piston.</p><p>In an eighth aspect, the invention extends to a method of fitting a ring cam segment to form a ring cam according to the sixth aspect, the method comprising the step of mounting a ring cam segment so that the piston facing surface of the ring cam segment forms part of the said working surface while concomitantly elastically deforming the ring cam segment to compress the piston facing surface of the segment.</p><p>The cam segment support may extend continuously between at least two said fixtures and typically between each said fixture, and preferably the step of mounting a ring cam segment comprises bringing the support facing surface of the segment into engagement with the cam segment support at or near to the leading and trailing ends of the segment, such that there is a gap between the support facing surface and the support extending at least part way between the leading and trailing ends of the segment (typically across the centre of the segment) and elastically deforming the segment to reduce (and preferably, eliminate) the gap. The segment may be elastically deformed when bolts connecting the segment to the cam segment support are tensioned.</p><p>According to a ninth aspect of the invention there is provided a ring cam segment having a working surface portion for operative engagement with a piston by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston, e.g. a piston shoe, or more typically a roller), the working surface portion describing a proportion, x, of a repeating wave (which may be generally sinusoidal), the segment having a curvature, the segment underlying the working surface portion curving by a fraction, y, of °, wherein x is not an integral multiple of y.</p><p>Typically, the ring cam segment requires to be flexed by at least .° to be fitted into a ring cam (that is to say, the relative orientation of the leading and trailing ends required to be changed by at least .Γ). The ring cam segment may be required to be flexed by . ° and in one embodiment is required to be flexed by .°. Typically, the ring cam segment requires to be flexed by least .% or . % (that is to say that the radius of curvature of the segment may be changed by between .% and .%, or in some embodiments between .% and .%).</p><p>Thus, each segment has a working surface portion which describes a proportion (which may be greater than, or less than, or equal to unity) of a repeating wave. However, the curvature of the segment, underlying the working surface portion, is not such that a plurality of the segments could be fitted together to form a ring cam having a continuous working surface comprising an integer number of waves without the segments being flexed and thereby elastically deformed. The segments are configured so that to form a ring cam having a continuous working surface comprising an integer number of waves, the segments must be flexed in the appropriate sense such that the working surface portions of the segments are held in compression.</p><p>According to a tenth aspect of the invention there is provided a fluid-working machine comprising a ring cam, a low pressure manifold, a high pressure manifold, at least one piston defining a working chamber, and at least one valve (which may be an electronically controlled valve, typically an electronically controlled face sealing poppet valve) associated with the or each working chamber for connecting the working chamber alternately to the low or the high pressure manifold in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume, the ring cam having a wave-like cam working surface for operative engagement with the at least one piston by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston, e.g. a piston shoe, or more typically a roller) so as to couple reciprocating motion of the at least one piston to rotation of the ring cam relative to the at least one piston and to thereby define the cycles of working chamber volume; the waves of the wave-like cam surface each having a leading face and a trailing face; characterised by discontinuities in the working surface located on (and typically only on) whichever of the leading face and the trailing face the at least one piston exerts does least work during normal operation resulting from the flow of fluid into and out of the working chamber in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume.</p><p>The said piston may do least work on one or other of the leading or trailing face during each said cycle of working chamber volume. For example, the pressure within a working chamber during each said cycle of working chamber volume typically varies cyclically and is at a maximum when the respective cam following element is bearing on one of the leading and trailing faces (such that the force exerted on the working surface is at a maximum and most work is done on the said faces), and is at a minimum when the cam following element is bearing on the other of the leading and trailing faces (such that the force exerted on the working surface is at a minimum and least work is done on the said faces).</p><p>The said piston may do least work on one or other of the leading or trailing face during the operating-lifetime of the fluid working machine, or of the ring cam. Least work may be done on one or other of the leading or trailing face over any given time period. For example, a fluid-working machine may have more than one operating mode and may have a first operating mode (which may be in a first direction of rotation) in which more work is done on one of the leading or trailing face during each said cycle of working chamber volume (or the majority of cycles) and a second operating mode (which may be in a second direction of motion) in which more work is done on the other of the leading or trailing face during each said cycle (or the majority of cycles) of working chamber volume, wherein the fluid-working machine functions in the first mode for the majority of the time (for example during normal operation) and the second mode for the minority of the time (for example, during maintenance), the said discontinuities located on (and typically only on) whichever of the leading face and the trailing face the at least one piston exerts does least work during the first mode of operation.</p><p>Typically, the ring cam comprises at least two segments extending around the circumference of the ring cam; and a support structure to which the said segments are attached; each said segment comprising a piston facing surface, the piston facing surfaces of the segments defining the working surface.</p><p>The said discontinuities in the working surface may be attachment means for securing said segments to the support structure. The attachment means may, for example, be one or more fixtures, such as bolts, extending through the working surface (typically, through a part of a segment piston facing surface which defines the working surface of the ring cam). The attachment means may comprise apertures through the said segments and/or recesses for receiving bolts.</p><p>The said discontinuities may be discontinuities between adjacent segments. It may be that the plurality of segments each comprising leading and trailing cooperating formations and the discontinuities in the working surface comprise interlocking regions where the leading and trailing cooperating formations of adjacent segments overlap across the respective interlocking region.</p><p>Wear on the ring cam working surface and the cam engaging elements increases with received force, and is greatest in regions of the working surface having a discontinuity (such as interlocking regions between ring cam segments, or attachment means for securing segments to a support structure). Therefore, the fluidworking machine of the invention, wherein force received in the regions of the working surface of the ring cam having discontinuities over time (i.e. work done on the said regions averaged over time and, in some embodiments, during each said cycle of working chamber volume) is lower in comparison to other regions. Thus, the rate of wear of the working surface and cam engaging elements is reduced.</p><p>Typically, the said discontinuities are located only on the said whichever of the leading face and the trailing face the pistons do least work during normal operation, (or do least work averaged over time, such as the operating lifetime of the fluidworking machine or the ring cam) resulting from the flow of fluid into and out of the working chamber in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume.</p><p>It may be that the said discontinuities are of a first type (e.g. attachment means, or said interlocking regions) and that the working surface comprises further discontinuities, of a second type, which are otherwise distributed, for example, within troughs between adjacent waves, or on both leading and trailing faces.</p><p>Typically, the fluid-working machine comprises a plurality of pistons arranged radially around the ring cam.</p><p>Each said cam engaging element may be biased against the working surface by fluid pressure from within the respective working chamber (during a part of or, more typically, all of each cycle of working chamber volume). Thus force on each said piston resulting from the pressure of working fluid in the respective working chamber is transmitted to the working surface by the or each said cam engaging element and bears upon the working surface (thereby doing work on the working surface). Each said cam engaging element may alternatively or in addition be biased against the working surface by an elastic member, such as a spring.</p><p>The fluid-working machine may be operable to limit the pressure in a said working chamber when a respective cam engaging element bears on a said discontinuity (to thereby reduce the force exerted on the region of the working surface comprising the discontinuity, such that the work done on the region of the working surface comprising the discontinuity is also limited).</p><p>Preferably, the working chamber is sealed from the high pressure manifold when the cam engaging element bears on the said discontinuities, in order that the pressure is limited within the working chamber when the cam engaging element bears on a said discontinuity. For example, the working chamber may be sealed from the high pressure manifold by way of a valve (referred to herein as the high pressure valve), which is typically an electronically controlled valve (such as a face seating poppet valve, which may be an electronically controlled face sealing poppet valve). Alternatively, or in addition, the working chamber may be placed in fluid communication with the low pressure manifold when the cam engaging element bears on the said discontinuities, for example by way of a valve (such as a face seating poppet valve, which may be an electronically controlled face sealing poppet valve) in order that the pressure is limited within the working chamber when the cam engaging element bears on a said discontinuity.</p><p>Typically, a contraction stroke occurs when the cam engaging element bears upon the leading face of a wave and an expansion stroke occurs when the cam engaging element bears upon the trailing face.</p><p>It may be that the fluid-working machine is a pump and each said discontinuity is located in a trailing face. In a pump, fluid will typically be received from the low pressure manifold during an expansion stroke while the respective cam engaging element bears on the trailing face and so each discontinuity will coincide with a period of relatively low pressure in the working chamber.</p><p>It may be that the fluid-working machine is a motor and each said discontinuity is located in a leading face. In such a motor, fluid will typically be displaced to the low pressure manifold during a contraction stroke while the respective cam engaging element bears on the leading face and so each discontinuity will coincide with a period of relative low pressure in the working chamber.</p><p>It may be that the said discontinuities are located in the working surface of only some of whichever of the leading face and the trailing face the pistons do least work during operation resulting from the flow of fluid into and out of the working chamber in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume in a first operating mode.</p><p>It may be that the fluid-working machine has a second operating mode in which it executes whichever of active pumping or active motoring cycles of working chamber volume cause the pistons to do a greater amount of work on the said whichever of the leading face and the trailing face the pistons do least work during operation in the first operating mode, and in which said active pumping or active motoring cycles are carried out selectively when the cam engaging element bears on the said whichever of the leading face and the trailing face the pistons do least work during operation in the first operating mode do not have the said discontinuities.</p><p>The first operating mode may be pumping and the faces on which the pistons do least work (or exert least force) during operation in the first operating mode may be the trailing faces and the second operating mode may be motoring.</p><p>The first operating mode may be motoring and the faces on which the pistons do least work (or exert least force) during operation in the first operating mode may be the leading faces and the second operating mode may be pumping.</p><p>Each said working chamber may comprise one or more electronically controllable valves, and the fluid-working machine may comprise a controller, operable to control the or each electronically controllable valve. Each said working chamber may be selectable by the controller, on a cycle by cycle basis, to conduct an active cycle (where there is a net displacement of working fluid) or an idle cycle (where there is substantially no net displacement of fluid), by virtue of control of the or each electronically controllable valve. Similarly, each said working chamber may be selectable to conduct an active pumping cycle or an active motoring cycle, on a cycle by cycle basis. It may be that the controller executes a program stored on a computer readable storage medium in use and the program determines whether least force is exerted, or least work is done, in use on the leading or trailing faces.</p><p>Thus, the invention extends in an eleventh aspect to a ring cam for a fluid working machine, the ring cam comprising a working surface for operative engagement with at least one piston by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston, e.g. a piston shoe, or more typically a roller) so as to couple reciprocating motion of the or each piston to rotation of the ring cam relative to the or each piston and to thereby define the cycles of working chamber volume; the working surface comprising a plurality of waves having leading and trailing faces, wherein the working surface comprises discontinuities either in the leading faces or the trailing faces of the said plurality of waves.</p><p>By the leading and trailing faces we refer to the faces of each wave on which each cam engaging element first and last engages, in use of the ring cam in a fluid-working machine. It may be that the ring cam is intended for use in either of two orientations in which case whichever sense is considered leading or trailing is arbitrary.</p><p>Every wave of the working surface may comprise a said discontinuity, or the working surface may comprise discontinuities mutually spaced by more than one wave length (for example only every one and a half waves, or only every second, or only every third wave). The working surface may comprise one or more waves not having a discontinuity therein.</p><p>Typically, the ring cam comprises at least two segments extending around the circumference of the ring cam; and a support structure to which the said segments are attached; each said segment comprising a piston facing surface, the piston facing surfaces of the segments defining the working surface.</p><p>It may be that the said discontinuities are discontinuities within the piston facing surfaces of the segments (rather than discontinuities between segments). The said discontinuities in the working surface may be attachment means for securing said segments to the support structure. The attachment means may, for example, be one or more fixtures, such as bolts, extending through the working surface (typically, through a part of a segment piston facing surface which defines the working surface of the ring cam). The attachment means may comprise apertures through the said segments or recesses for receiving bolts.</p><p>However, it may be that the discontinuities are interfaces between adjacent segments. For example, it may be that each of the plurality of segments each comprising leading and trailing cooperating formations and the said discontinuities in the working surface comprise interlocking regions where the leading and trailing cooperating formations of adjacent segments overlap across the respective interlocking region.</p><p>Typically, the said discontinuities are located only on the said leading faces or only on the said trailing faces.</p><p>It may be that the said discontinuities are located only in some of the said leading or trailing faces. For example, in alternate leading or trailing faces, or every three or four leading or trailing faces, or in two out of every three, or three out of every four leading or trailing faces.</p><p>In some embodiments there is more than one discontinuity (for example one and a half, or two, or more than two) per wave (and therefore per cycle of working chamber volume).</p><p>The waves of the working surface may be sinusoidal.</p><p>According to a twelfth aspect of the invention, of the invention there is provided a method of operating a fluid-working machine, the fluid-working machine comprising a ring cam, a low pressure manifold, a high pressure manifold, at least one piston defining a working chamber, and at least one valve (which may be an electronically controlled valve, typically an electronically controlled face sealing poppet valve) associated with the or each working chamber for connecting the working chamber alternately to the low or the high pressure manifold in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume, the ring cam having a wave-like cam working surface for operative engagement with the at least one piston by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston, e.g. a piston shoe, or more typically a roller) so as to couple reciprocating motion of the at least one piston to rotation of the ring cam relative to the at least one piston and to thereby define the cycles of working chamber volume; the waves of the wave-like cam surface each having a leading face and a trailing face; the leading or trailing faces comprising discontinuities, the method characterised by the at least one piston doing least work during normal operation resulting from the flow of fluid into and out of the working chamber in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume on whichever of the leading face and the trailing face comprise the discontinuities.</p><p>It may be that only some of the said leading or trailing faces comprise said discontinuities.</p><p>According to a thirteenth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of operating a fluid-working machine, the fluid-working machine comprising a ring cam, a low pressure manifold, a high pressure manifold, at least one piston defining a working chamber of cyclically varying volume, and at least one electronically controlled valve associated with the or each working chamber for connecting the working chamber alternately to a said low pressure manifold and a said high pressure manifold in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume; the ring cam having a working surface for operative engagement with the or each piston by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston, e.g. a piston shoe, or a roller) so as to couple reciprocating motion of the or each piston to rotation of the ring cam relative to the or each piston and to thereby define the cycles of working chamber volume; one or more regions of the working surface having a discontinuity; the method characterised by limiting the working fluid pressure in a said working chamber when the respective cam engaging element (i.e. the cam engaging element through which the piston defining the said working chamber engages within the cam working surface) bears on a said discontinuity in the working surface.</p><p>Thus, the fluid pressure in the working chamber when the cam engaging element bears upon a discontinuity (and, in some embodiments, the leading face or trailing face in which the discontinuity is located) is typically less than the pressure in the working chamber when the cam engaging element bears upon another region of the working surface. Consequently, the work done by the said pistons on the working surface, and the wear of the working surface, in the region of a discontinuity is reduced.</p><p>The ring cam may be a ring cam according to the eleventh aspect of the invention.</p><p>It may be that the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber is limited by sealing the working chamber from the high pressure manifold when the cam engaging element passes over (i.e. bears on) the discontinuity, for example, by controlling the timing of opening or closing of a said electronically controlled valve regulating the flow of fluid between the working chamber and the high pressure manifold.</p><p>It may be that the ring comprises a plurality of waves having leading and trailing faces and the said discontinuities are located in one of the leading or the trailing faces and the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber is limited by synchronising active cycles of working chamber volume with rotation of the ring cam such that the point in each active cycle of working chamber volume where working chamber pressure is greatest occurs while the cam engaging element bears on the other of the leading or the trailing faces.</p><p>It may be that the ring cam comprises a plurality of waves having leading and trailing faces and the said discontinuities are located in only some of the said leading or only some of the said trailing faces (for example on alternate leading faces, or only every third leading face, or on alternate trailing faces, or only every third trailing face); and the fluid-working machine has a first operating mode (e.g. pumping) in which the pressure in each working chamber exceeds a threshold when (and typically only when) the respective cam engaging element bears on the other of the said leading or the trailing faces (i.e. those in which the discontinuities are not located);</p><p>and (typically) the pressure in each working chamber does not exceed the threshold when the respective cam engaging element bears on each of the said discontinuities (or when the respective cam engaging element bears on the portion comprising a said discontinuity, or all of each of the said leading or trailing faces in which the discontinuities are located);</p><p>and a second operating mode (e.g. motoring, or a second pumping mode in which the ring cam rotates in the opposite direction to the first mode) in which the pressure in each working chamber does not exceed the threshold when the cam engaging element bears on the said discontinuities (or on the said leading or trailing faces in which the discontinuities are located).</p><p>It may be that working fluid pressure in the said working chamber is limited (for example in a second operating mode) by selecting the timing of active cycles of working chamber volume in the said operating modes so that the pressure does not exceed the threshold the majority, or preferably all, of the times when the cam engaging element bears on a said discontinuity (or, in some embodiments, on the said leading or trailing faces in which the discontinuities are located).</p><p>The threshold may be a pressure value, or may be a range of values. The threshold may be selected as a proportion of the pressure in the high pressure manifold, or as a proportion of the maximum rated operating pressure of the said working chambers, or the threshold may be empirically determined in relation to the physical properties of the ring cam. The threshold may be varied according to the operating requirements of the fluid working machine.</p><p>Typically, the net displacement of working fluid on each cycle of working chamber volume is determined by controlling the said one or more electronically controllable valves. Typically, on each cycle of working volume, a decision is made as to whether to carry out an active cycle in which a net displacement of working fluid is made (e.g. an active pumping cycle or an active motoring cycle) or an idle cycle in which no net displacement of fluid is made.</p><p>Preferably the fluid pressure within a working chamber is limited to a pressure substantially lower than the maximum pressure during a typical active cycle of working chamber volume when the respective cam engaging element bears on a said discontinuity. Accordingly, the threshold is typically substantially lower than the maximum pressure during a typical active cycle of working chamber volume. For example, the pressure may be limited to less than  Bar,  Bar or  Bar. The pressure may be limited to less than %, or less than %, of the maximum rated operating pressure of the working chamber, or the maximum pressure during a typical active cycle of working chamber volume.</p><p>Typically, the pressure within a working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume varies cyclically and is at a maximum when the respective cam following element is bearing on one of the leading and trailing faces, and is at a minimum when the cam following element is bearing on the other of the leading and trailing faces. Accordingly, the working chamber typically executes an active cycle in which the pressure within the working chamber reaches a maximum when the respective cam engaging element bears on leading or trailing faces not having a discontinuity therein. In some embodiments, it may be that the working chamber is operable to execute an active cycle in which the pressure within the working chamber reaches a maximum while the respective cam engaging element bears on a leading or trailing face having a discontinuity (e.g. attachment means) therein only if a measured (or predicted) pressure, such as the pressure in the high pressure manifold measured by a pressure sensor, is below the threshold.</p><p>It may be that the net volume of fluid to be displaced by a said working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume is selected or selectable responsive to the pressure in the high pressure manifold and/or the position of each said roller (or other cam engaging element) in relation to each said discontinuity (e.g. attachment means).</p><p>In some embodiments, the controller is operable to control (by opening, closing or prevention of the opening or closing) the one or more of the electronically controlled valves to select a volume of working fluid to be displaced, or to prevent displacement of working fluid, by a said working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume, when the associated roller, or other cam engaging element, bears on a discontinuity, to thereby limit the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber.</p><p>It may be that the net volume of fluid to be displaced by a said working chamber during a cycle of working chamber volume is selected or selectable responsive to the pressure in the high pressure manifold and/or the position of the or each cam engaging element in relation to each said discontinuity, to thereby limit the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber.</p><p>In some embodiments, the controller is operable to control (by opening, closing or prevention of the opening or closing) the one or more of the electronically controlled valves to select a volume working fluid to be displaced, or to prevent displacement of working fluid by a said working during a cycle of working chamber volume, to thereby limit the working fluid pressure in the said working chamber, when the associated cam engaging element, bears on a discontinuity. Thus, each said working chamber may be selectable or selected, by the controller, on a cycle by cycle basis to execute an active cycle or an idle cycle, or a part active cycle, or a pumping cycle or a motoring cycle, so as to limit the pressure of working fluid in the said working chamber, when the cam engaging element bears on a discontinuity in the working surface.</p><p>The method may comprise reading discontinuity location data from a computer readable data storage medium (e.g. a memory) which stores data concerning the location of each said discontinuity in relation to the relative orientation of the ring cam. The method may comprise reading ring cam orientation data (e.g. from a sensor) and determining whether a cam engaging element associated with a working chamber will or will not pass over a discontinuity on the leading or trailing face of a wave of the ring cam surface during a particular cycle of working chamber responsive to that data.</p><p>According to a fourteenth aspect of the invention, there is provided a fluid-working machine comprising a ring cam, a low pressure manifold, a high pressure manifold, at least one piston defining a working chamber of cyclically varying volume, and at least one electronically controlled valve associated with the or each working chamber for connecting the working chamber alternately to a said low pressure manifold and a said high pressure manifold in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume; the ring cam having a working surface for operative engagement with the or each piston by way of a cam engaging element (such as a part of the piston, e.g. a piston shoe, or a roller) so as to couple reciprocating motion of the or each piston to rotation of the ring cam relative to the or each piston and to thereby define the cycles of working chamber volume; one or more regions of the working surface having a discontinuity;_characterised by the machine being operable to limit the working fluid pressure in a said working chamber when the respective cam engaging element bears on a said discontinuity in the working surface.</p><p>Preferred and optional features described in relation to any of the first through fourteenth aspects of the invention correspond are preferred and optional features of any of the first through fourteenth aspects of the invention.</p><p>The invention also extends to a kit of parts which, when assembled, forms a ring cam according to the first aspect of the invention, or according to the third aspect of the invention, or according to the sixth aspect of the invention or according to the eleventh aspect of the invention, or a fluid-working machine according to the second aspect of the invention, or according to the fourth aspect of the invention, or according to the seventh aspect of the invention, or according to the tenth aspect of the invention, or according to the fourteenth aspect of the invention.</p><p>The invention also extends to a kit of parts comprising a cam segment support and a plurality of cam segments according to the ninth aspect of the invention, or disclosed in relation to any of the first through twelfth aspects, wherein the piston facing surfaces of the plurality of cam segments together form a ring cam working surface having an integral number of waves when elastically deformed and fitted to the cam segment support.</p><p>The invention also extends to a computer readable medium storing program code which when executed on a fluid working machine controller, causes the controller to carry out a method according to the twelfth or thirteenth aspect of the invention.</p><p>Description of the Drawings</p><p>An example embodiment of the present invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Figures in which:</p><p>Figure (a) is a plan view of a portion of a working surface of a ring cam of a wind turbine pump, defined by the piston facing surfaces of two cooperatively engaged cam segments;</p><p>Figure (b) is an axial section along line A of a ring cam of a wind turbine pump, showing two cam segments secured to the turbine drive shaft, schematically depicting the position of axial piston rollers, and a working chamber, in relation to the working surface defined by the cam segments;</p><p>Figure  shows a schematic axial section of a portion of a cam support structure and a cam segment (a) in an un-stressed state prior to being secured to the support structure and (b) secured to the support structure and in a pre-stressed state; and</p><p>Figure  is a cross-section through a section of a ring cam comprising a plurality of segments having apertures in alternate trailing faces.</p><p>Detailed Description of an Example Embodiment</p><p>With reference to Figure  (b), a portion of a ring cam  is formed from cam segments  and , secured by bolts  which extend from apertures  in the surface of the cam segments and fix the cam segments to a cam support structure . A plurality of further cam segments (not shown) are securable to the cam support structure, to make up the complete ring cam. The cam support structure is coupled to drive shaft  (which rotates in direction B in normal use) through which torque is received from an energy source (e.g. the blades of a wind or tidal turbine).</p><p>Each cam segment has a piston facing surface ,  which defines a portion of the working surface of the ring cam. Thus, the ring cam has a working surface defined by a plurality of cam segments secured around the circumference of the drive shaft. The working surface is wave-like and comprises a plurality of waves having leading surfaces  and trailing surfaces  (defined relative to the direction of rotation). The waves may be generally sinusoidal although this is not essential. The piston facing surfaces preferably have a heat and/or chemical treatment applied during manufacture to achieve the desired surface properties.</p><p>Notches in the segments  and shaft  mate with keys  that prevent the segments rotating around the shaft, acting as a slip preventing feature. Cross bolt holes  are for holding side plates (, shown in Figure ) to the segments, which prevent the rollers  from sliding off the rolling surface. Alternatively, a convex or concave camber may be applied to the rollers and/or the piston facing surfaces to achieve the same outcome.</p><p>Each segment , has at one end a trailing tongue formation  (being an example of a trailing cooperating formation) and, at the other end, a groove formation  formed between two leading tongue formations  (together forming an example of a leading cooperating formation).</p><p>Leading segment  has a trailing edge  which interlocks with a leading edge  of groove formation  of the trailing segment . The tongue and groove formations in combination act as the interlocking region.</p><p>The faces of the tongue ,  and groove ,  formations may be perpendicular to the shaft as shown, or may be at another angle to the shaft. The tongue and groove formations may cooperate to fix the segments relative to each other by end faces ,  and side faces , , which need not be parallel, together arranged so as to make the fit between tongue and groove formations tight or loose as desired. Tongue  has cut away leading edges leaving a gap  to improve the fit between the segments and avoid buckling. A number of other suitable formations will present themselves to those skilled in the art.</p><p>The piston facing surface of each segment extends continuously from the outer surface of the leading tongue formations to the outer surface of the trailing tongue formation, The piston facing surface of the leading tongue formations of the trailing segment  form part of the working surface at a trailing region of the leading tongue formations, but is gradually recessed along the length of the leading tongue formations, such that the piston facing surface  is recessed from the working surface at the leading end of the trailing segment. The piston facing surface of the trailing tongue formation of the leading segment  forms part of the working surface at a leading region, but is gradually recessed along the length of the trailing tongue formation, such that the piston facing surface  is recessed from the working surface at the trailing edge  of the leading segment. Thus, the piston facing surfaces of each segment predominantly forms parts of the working surface of the ring cam, however, there is also a part of the piston facing surface at each end of each segment which does not form part of the working surface of the ring cam (and which is recessed from the working surface of the ring cam).</p><p>Because the piston facing surface of the tongues is recessed towards the leading end of the leading cooperating formations of the trailing segment and the trailing end of the trailing cooperating formation of the leading segment, the piston facing surfaces of the leading segment and the trailing segments subtend an angle of close to but less than .°, for example .° at the interlocking region.</p><p>In order to form a fluid-working machine, pistons  are coupled to the ring cam by way of rollers  which bear on the working surface and roll along the working surface in use so as to reciprocate the pistons within cylinders . The pistons and cylinders together define working chambers  of cyclically varying volume and the volume cycles of the working chambers are defined by the wave-like shape of the working surface of the ring cam over which the rollers pass. The pistons are biased against the working surface of the ring cam by springs (not shown) and/or by the pressure of working fluid within the working chambers. The cylinders and pistons are slightly canted so that the central axis of each piston and cylinder does not extend directly radially outwards from the centre of the ring cam. This reduces lateral forces of the pistons acting against the cylinders when the working surface is heavily loaded in use.</p><p>In use, either of the leading surfaces  or trailing surfaces  may be subject to the greatest load, in use, depending on application (for example, whether the fluidworking machine is functioning as a pump or as a motor). The axis of each of the working chambers (as defined by the path of the pistons) is typically canted away from the radius of the ring cam and towards an axis which is perpendicular to whichever of the leading or trailing surfaces are under greatest loading during normal use. For example, if only the leading surfaces are heavily loaded (e.g. the machine is rotated in direction B and used predominantly (or only) as a pump), the axis of the working chamber may be canted slightly (typically in the region of °-°) clockwise (in relation to the orientation of Figure (b)) towards an axis perpendicular to the leading surfaces .</p><p>A controller  is provided to read the angular position and speed of the shaft via a shaft sensor  and to control the low pressure valves  and (optionally) high pressure valves  for each cylinder according to a control algorithm. The low pressure valves alternately place the working chamber in fluid communication with, and isolate the working chamber from, a low pressure manifold . The high pressure valves alternately place the working chamber in fluid communication with, and isolate the working chamber from, a high pressure manifold . The manifolds are connected to sources or sinks of working fluid (not shown). The valves are ideally face-seating poppet type valves, with the low pressure valve oriented to allow fluid into the working chamber and optionally out of the chamber (when controllably held open) and the high pressure valve oriented to allow fluid out of the working chamber and optionally into the working chamber (when controllably held open).</p><p>In use, the ring cam rotates in the direction B in relation to the working chambers, and rollers  roll over the most leading part  of the piston facing surface of the leading tongue formation of the trailing segment  before the most trailing part  of the piston facing surface of the trailing tongue formation  of the leading segment . Because the most leading part  of the piston facing surface of the trailing segment is below the piston facing surface  of the leading segment (which forms part of the working surface), the roller may smoothly transition from one segment to the next. Even if there is a slight mismatch between leading and trailing segments (as can result from deviations in dimensions within manufacturing tolerances), this will only lead to a slight difference in the location at which the roller transfers from one segment to the next but would not lead to jarring as the rollers would not encounter a discontinuity in the working surface.</p><p>The interlocking region is located so that the working chamber  is expanding when its roller passes from one segment to the next, i.e. it is located at a trailing surface  of the working surface, and so the force exerted on the ring cam by the pistons, through the rollers as they pass over an interlocking region, is not at a maximum.</p><p>By controlling the opening and closing of the low (and optionally high) pressure valves, the net volume of working fluid displaced by each chamber can be selected for each cycle of working chamber volume to enable the overall fluid displacement to be matched to a demand signal, such as a fluid volume demand signal or an output pressure signal. Suitable control algorithms are disclosed in EP   , EP    and EP   , the contents of which are incorporated herein by virtue of this reference.</p><p>Thus, the invention provides a mechanism to enable rollers, or other cam engaging elements, to move smoothly from one segment to next, minimising wear. However, as a plurality of segments are provided, they can be individually checked, maintained and replaced if need be.</p><p>Furthermore, the bolts  (functioning as attachment means) are located in bores extending from apertures  which are also located in the trailing surfaces  of the working surface, and thus the force exerted on the ring cam by the pistons, through the rollers as they pass over the apertures, is also not at a maximum.</p><p>The phase of the cycles of working chamber volume is defined by the waves in the working surface of the ring cam. In this example, the ring cam is part of a fluid working pump and so the forces acting on the ring cam from the pistons are greatest during the compression stroke of each working chamber which coincides with the rollers passing along the leading surfaces . If the fluid working machine was a fluid working motor (or operated for a substantial proportion of the time as a motor, or if the highest torque requirement (and thus the greatest forces transmitted to the working surface) was when operating as a motor), the bolts would instead be advantageously located in bores extending from apertures in the working surface of the leading surfaces . This enables the attachment means to be provided in the working surfaces (thereby enabling the ring cam and the fluid working machine to be more compact and lighter than known apparatus) while minimising wear on the rollers, or other cam engaging elements, which might otherwise result from the discontinuities caused by the apertures in the working surface.</p><p>It may be that the segments are manufactured by fracturing a continuous ring into smaller parts, for example by making a plurality of notches or imperfections in the continuous ring and then expanding or otherwise overstressing said ring to fracture it.</p><p>Figure  (a) shows in exaggerated form how a segment  might be formed with a fixing surface (a support facing surface)  having a smaller radius of curvature than the outer surface  (functioning as a cam segment support) of the shaft  to which it is to be fixed, causing there to be a gap  between the segment and the shaft where the segment is placed against the shaft.</p><p>Figure  (b) illustrates a fixing force  into the shaft, which is typically exerted by attachment means (for example, bolts  of segments , shown in figures (a) and (b)). Fixing force  deforms the segment  to close the gap , bringing the segment into cooperative engagement with the outer surface  (as shown in Figure (b)). A tangential compressive stress  is induced in the segment and, in particular, in the piston facing surface , as a result of the deformation of the segment by fixing force .</p><p>The tangential compressive stress is exerted generally parallel to the piston facing surface over which rollers pass in use. This tangential compressive stress increases the longevity of the rolling surface when subject to very high forces from passing rollers. Highly loaded passing rollers would otherwise cause localised compression of the rolling surface towards the shaft, which would otherwise cause tangential tensile stress in the piston facing surface. Thus, the compressive stress  offsets some of the tensile stress. Indeed, in some alternative embodiments, the compressive stress may exceed the expected tensile stress so that the piston facing surface is not subject to tangential tensile stresses during normal use.</p><p>Thus, the curvature of the piston facing surface of the segment, and the curvature of the opposite surface are different and so the segment must be flexed (and thereby elastically deformed) in order to be fitted to a curved cam segment support. In this case, the curvature of the cam segment support facing side of the segment is greater than the curvature of the cam segment support. In alternative embodiments, the segments may be intended to be retained on an inward facing cam segment support, so as to provide an inward facing working surface (for example in a radial piston machine where the pistons are located within the ring cam). In this case, in order that the piston facing surfaces of the cam segments may be placed under tangential compressive stress, the support facing surface of the segments may be provided with a greater radius of curvature than the fixing surface.</p><p>In comparison to known ring cams, consisting of segments secured to a support structure by flanges (or other attachment means) extending to either side of the working surface, attachment means (e.g. bolts) extending through the working (or piston facing) surface enable the piston facing surfaces of the segments to be placed in greater compression.</p><p>In general, the segment  has been configured such that it cannot be fitted into a ring cam without being elastically deformed to create compressive stress in the piston facing surface, and in the working surface of the assembled ring cam. The working surface of the segment (the piston facing surface minus any parts which are typically recessed below the piston facing surface of an adjacent segment in use) defines a proportion, x, of a wave of a ring cam working surface. In the example shown in Figure , this proportion is .. However, the curvature of the segment underlying the working surface (i.e. ignoring parts which do not engage with the rollers or other cam engaging elements in use) is a fraction, y, of ° which is not an integral multiple of x. For example, the curvature of the segment underlying the working surface may be ° and so y=.. The ratio x/y = .() in this example, which is not an integer. Thus, the working surface provided by the segment is mismatched with the curvature of the segment itself and the segment cannot be used to form a ring cam having only other segments of corresponding shape, as a ring cam should have an integral number of waves.</p><p>Segment  is also provided with (optional) cross apertures , which extend through the segment generally parallel to the axis of rotation of the assembled ring cam and the piston facing surface. The cross apertures provide zones of greater compressibility than the surrounding material of the segment and facilitate deformation of the segment, enabling a given tangential compressive force to be generated with a lower fixing force. One or more cross apertures may be positioned and dimensioned to achieve a desired distribution of tangential compressive forces through the segment. For example, the position and dimensions of the cross apertures may be selected so as to concentrate compressive forces on the leading surface, or the steepest portions of the leading surfaces.</p><p>In some embodiments, the ring cam segments are formed with the cross apertures  located in the region of whichever of the leading face or the trailing faces of the waves which make up the ring cam the pistons will exert most force during operation. This force varies cyclically during active cycles as fluid flows into and out of working chambers in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume. The variation in pressure during cycles of working chamber volume depends on the function of the machine. If the machine is a pump, the apertures are located in the leading faces, so that the rollers pass over the apertures during contraction strokes, when the respective working chamber may be in fluid communication with the high pressure manifold, and the pressure within the working chamber is above the pressure of the low pressure manifold as a result. If the machine is a motor, the apertures are located in the trailing faces, so that the rollers pass over the apertures during expansion strokes, when the respective working chamber is receiving working fluid from the high pressure manifold. In both cases, during an active cycle, the working chamber is open to the high pressure manifold whenever the working chamber passes over a cross aperture.</p><p>In practice, it is the curvature of the cam segment support between fixing points which is important and the cam segment support may not have a continuous curvature, or even be a continuous surface as shown in the figures.</p><p>Although the cam segments are illustrated having cooperating formations in the form of a tongue at a first end and two tongues defining a groove at the other end, any of a wide range of other arrangements are possible. Tongues may be straight, curved, or generally triangular, for example. The cam segments may have a single tongue at either end, which tongues are adjacent each other in the assembled device, thereby forming the interlocking region in use.</p><p>In some embodiments, the ring cam segments are formed with the apertures  located in only whichever of the leading face or the trailing faces of the waves which make up the ring cam the pistons will exert least force during operation. This force varies cyclically during active cycles as fluid flows into and out of working chambers in phased relationship to cycles of working chamber volume. The variation in pressure during cycles of working chamber volume depends on the function of the machine. If the machine is a pump, the apertures are located in the trailing faces, so that the rollers pass over the apertures during expansion strokes, when the respective working chamber is in fluid communication with the low pressure manifold, and the pressure within the working chamber is at or below the pressure of the low pressure manifold as a result. If the machine is a motor, the apertures are located in the leading faces, so that the rollers pass over the apertures during contraction strokes, when the respective working chamber is venting working fluid to the low pressure manifold. In both cases, the working chamber is sealed from the high pressure manifold whenever the working chamber passes over an aperture. The apertures are examples of discontinuities in the working surfaces and other discontinuities, such as the interlocking regions between adjacent segments, may also be distributed in the same way.</p><p>With reference to Figure , in some embodiments, apertures  are provided in only some of the trailing faces. The cam segment of Figure  is especially useful in a fluid-working machine operable typically as a pump, but also operable as a motor in some conditions (for example to provide a positioning function). Thus, during pumping, the rollers only pass over apertures while the respective piston cylinder is expanding and the pressure within the working chamber is relatively low. However, during motoring, although the pressure within the working chamber will be relatively high when the rollers bear on the trailing faces during active motoring cycles, the active motoring cycles are selected to coincide with the rollers passing over the trailing faces, or those portions of the trailing faces, of the waves lacking apertures. Instead, the working chambers always execute idle strokes with no net displacement of working fluid, during cycles when they bear on trailing faces having apertures. This restricts the maximum throughput of working fluid during motoring but there are numerous applications where it is acceptable for maximum displacement during motoring to be less than maximum displacement during pumping, for example, a machine driven by the blades of a wind turbine will typically be operated as a pump but could occasionally be driven as a motor to control the location of the blades, e.g. for maintenance. In order to time active cycles to coincide with the rollers passing over trailing faces the controller refers to a database of which trailing faces include apertures (and where the apertures are located), and continuous measurements of the angular position of the ring cam received from shaft sensor , and takes this into account on each selection of the volume of working fluid to be displaced by each working chamber on each successive cycle of working chamber volume.</p><p>In some embodiments, the controller may cause a working chamber to execute a partial motoring cycle in which the controller closes the high pressure valve before the roller bears on an aperture (or an interlocking region, or any other discontinuity in the working surface), so that the pressure within the working chamber is limited below a threshold when the roller bears on an aperture (or an interlocking region).</p><p>In some embodiments, the controller may allow a working chamber to execute a motoring cycle while the corresponding roller passes over a trailing face including an aperture only if the pressure within the high pressure manifold is below a threshold, in which case the force bearing on the ring cam through the roller is anyway not excessively high.</p><p>Optionally, the fluid-working machine is also operable to function as a pump in a second (opposite) direction of rotation. In this case the leading faces (when the fluid working machine is rotating in a first direction) become the trailing faces (when the fluid-working machine is rotating in the second direction) and the trailing faces (when the fluid working machine is rotating in a first direction) become the leading faces (when the fluid-working machine is rotating in the second direction). In some embodiments, when rotating in the second direction, the controller may allow a working chamber to execute a pumping cycle while the corresponding roller passes over a trailing face including an aperture only if the pressure within the high pressure manifold is below a threshold, in which case the force bearing on the ring cam through the roller is anyway not excessively high. In some embodiments, when rotating in the second direction, the controller may allow a working chamber to execute a partial pumping cycle in which the controller closes the low pressure valve after the roller bears on an aperture (or an interlocking region), so that the pressure within the working chamber is below a threshold when the roller bears on an aperture (or an interlocking region).</p><p>For a machine operated predominantly as a motor, and in some conditions as a pump, the apertures can be located in some of the leading rather than some of the trailing faces.</p><p>The ring cam further comprises side plates (on one or, more preferably, both sides of the ring cam) extending around the circumference of the ring cam (and each side plate typically also abutting an edge of the working surface of the ring cam), which prevent the rollers from sliding off the wave-like surface of the ring cam. In embodiments with two or more ring cams, there may be one side plate positioned intermediate two cam rings which functions to prevent rollers from sliding off both cam rings. Alternatively, each of the two or more cam rings may have separate side plates.</p><p>The side plates may be unitary, or may be segmented as shown in Figure . In the embodiment shown in Figure , ring cam segment  is secured to a side plate segment  (and typically to two side place segments, to either side of the wave like surface of the segment). In alternative embodiments there may be fewer, or more, side plate segments disposed around each side of the circumference of the or each ring cam than there are ring cam segments.</p><p>The side plates are held to the segment  by bolts  extending through cross bolt holes. The bolts may each extend through more than one ring cam (or ring cam segment) or more than one side plates (or side plate segments).</p><p>The side plate segments of the ring cam may be angularly offset from the cam segments so that each side plate overlaps two (or more) segments of the assembled ring cam. Thus, and in the assembled ring cam, the joint between side plate segments does not align or overlap with the joint between segments and the overlapping portion  of a side plate segment secured to a ring cam segment may be used to axially (i.e. with respect to the shaft) align the cam segment to an adjacent cam segment (for example during assembly and maintenance, or to reduce wear caused by motion of adjacent ring cam segments in relation to one another, when forces are applied to the wave like surface, in use). In some embodiments the side plates may be fixed to the shaft, or fixed relative to the valves and working chambers such that the cam segments move between the side plates.</p><p>The ring cam of the present invention is especially useful as a component of large fluid working machines where access may be difficult and a long ring cam working life is important. For example, the ring cam may be part of a pump within the nacelle of a wind turbine tower (which are typically in excess of  m in height), or an offshore wind turbine tower, with the drive shaft coupled to the blades of a wind turbine, and where it is not practicable to remove the fluid-working machine, or the wind turbine blades, for maintenance or repair.</p><p>Further variations and modifications may be made within the scope of the invention herein disclosed.</p></description>    3\n",
       "<description lang=\"en\" load-source=\"lhip\" data-format=\"original\"><p>A Floor Tool for a Vacuum Cleaning Appliance</p><p>Technical field</p><p>The present invention relates to a floor tool for a vacuum cleaning appliance, and a vacuum cleaning appliance incorporating such a floor tool, whether as a detachable component or as an integral part.</p><p>Background of the invention</p><p>Vacuum cleaners are generally supplied with a range of tools for dealing with different cleaning tasks. For example, such a tool may be a general purpose floor tool for on-thefloor cleaning of both hard and textile surface coverings. Typically, a floor tool comprises a main body which engages with a floor surface. The main body has a lower surface comprising a suction opening through which dirt and dust may be drawn into the floor tool due to a suction force generated by a vacuum cleaner to which the tool is attached. Although floor tools are adept at removing loose dirt and debris from a floor surface, they are less accomplished at removing other forms of dirt, for example stains, which may be left behind from liquid that is spilt on a hard floor covering. Of course, there are implements available for cleaning such stains. One example is shown in US/, in which a long handled cleaning implement includes a cleaning head to which a cleaning sheet is removably attached. Such an implement can then be used by a user to scrub or mop a hard floor surface to remove stubborn stains.</p><p>It also is known to combine the functionality of a vacuum cleaner floor tool with a cleaning sheet in order to provide the floor tool with the facility to wipe dirt and stains from a floor surface in addition to the usual function of sucking up loose dirt and debris. By way of example, JP describes a device which combines a mop with a vacuum cleaner floor tool by arranging an elongate nozzle adjacent a mop holder to which a mop is attached. The floor tool therefore carries out floor wiping and vacuum cleaning functions. Also, EP discloses a floor tool for a vacuum cleaner in which a rectangular supporting element carries a disposable wipe and wherein elongate suction nozzles are positioned adjacent the fore and aft long edges of the support element.</p><p>Although such combined mop and suction floor tools have their advantages, the cleaning performance of such tools on hard floors tends to be compromised and their versatility is limited. It is with a view to addressing these drawbacks that the invention has been devised.</p><p>Summary of the invention</p><p>In a first aspect, the invention provides a floor tool that may be integral with or removably connectable to a vacuum cleaning appliance, the floor tool comprising a support member adapted to support a cleaning sheet and at least one suction nozzle in communication with a conduit that is coupled to a vacuum cleaning appliance, in use, wherein a neck for controlling the floor tool is coupled to the support member and wherein the at least one suction nozzle is configured so as to float relative to the neck.</p><p>The invention therefore provides a floor tool in the context of a vacuum cleaning appliance that has a dual functionality. Firstly, the floor tool provides a suction cleaning function and, secondly, the floor tool has the capability to carry a cleaning sheet to wipe the floor surface at the same time as vacuuming the floor surface. The suction nozzle is configured to float relative to the connecting neck of the floor tool which confers several benefits. Firstly, the downwards force applied to the user via the neck is transmitted directly to the support member, but not to the suction nozzle, the downwards pressure improving the cleaning performance of the wipe sheet carried on the support member. Secondly, since very little downwards force is applied to the suction nozzle, it is able to ride lightly across the floor surface which benefits the pickup performance of the suction nozzle.</p><p>Although the floor tool of the invention may include a single suction nozzle located adjacent a leading or trailing edge of the support member, an alternative embodiment includes first and second suction nozzles, one nozzle located adjacent a respective one of the leading and trailing edges of the support member.</p><p>In the preferred embodiment, the suction nozzles communicate with a manifold that may be located in a central position with respect to the support member, each of the suction nozzles being linked to the manifold by a fluid carrying arm. The fluid carrying arms and the nozzles are therefore configured into an ‘overslung’ arrangement over the support member.</p><p>The manifold may extend through a part of the neck of the floor tool and may be dimensioned so that the manifold is permitted to move relative to the neck in order to provide the suction nozzles with the ability to ‘float’. To allow a user to manoeuvre the floor tool the neck may define a first portion that is pivotably attached to the support member about a first axis. The first portion may be cylindrical in form that defines a rail arrangement arranged at least partially about its periphery and which is engaged with a complementary runner formation on the support member so that the rail arrangement can ride/slide along the runners. Since only the peripheral edge of the cylindrical base portion engages with the support member, the central volume of the cylindrical base portion is substantially free of obstructions so that the manifold can pass through it, thereby coupling the manifold to the support member.</p><p>In order to provide a further degree of manoeuvrability, the neck may include a second portion that is pivotably connected to the base portion about a second axis that is perpendicular to the first axis. This allows the floor tool to be swivelled in a plane parallel to the floor surface by rotating the neck, effectively providing the floor tool with the ability to be ‘steered’.</p><p>In the illustrated embodiment, the manifold communicates with a flexible hose that extends through the second portion of the neck to a connecting part and so serves to duct air from the manifold to an associated vacuum cleaner via the neck.</p><p>In a second aspect, the invention provides a floor tool for a vacuum cleaning appliance comprising a body including a suction nozzle, a neck coupled to the body so as to pivot relative to it about an axis ‘A’, wherein the neck includes a base portion that defines a rail formation located at least partially about its circumference and the body includes a runner formation that is engaged with a discrete part of the rail formation, the rail formation being slidable relative to the runner formation thereby coupling the base portion to the body but permitting the base portion to pivot relative to the body. More particularly, the rail formation may include a rim of the base portion and the runner formation on the body may include a projection that overlaps the rim and is slidable relative to it. In this way, the body holds the base portion of the neck at a discrete point on its rim which means that the centre of the base portion can be left open. The open central area of the base portion is therefore able to receive a conduit of the floor tool. By selection of the dimension of the conduit relative to the base portion, the conduit can be configured to flat relative to the base portion.</p><p>The pivoting movement of the neck may be limited by a flange extending inwardly from the rim about a limited portion thereof, the end points of the flange defining limit stops for pivoting movement of the base portion.</p><p>The floor tool described above provides a dual function tool which works to suck debris from the floor and also to clean the floor with a wet or dry cleaning wipe. However, it is possible that a user may wish to vacuum the floor without needing to wipe the floor as well. Therefore, in a third aspect, the invention provides a floor tool for a vacuum cleaning appliance comprising a support member adapted to support a cleaning sheet and at least one suction nozzle in communication with a conduit, wherein the support member comprises a removable pad which is detachable from the support member and a rolling arrangement depending from the support member.</p><p>The invention enhances the versatility of the floor tool since the tool can be used in a “suction-and-wipe” mode of operation in which the suction nozzles combine in function with the removable pad, and a ‘suction-only’ mode of operation in which only the suction nozzles are involved with cleaning the floor surface. Such an arrangement may, in practice, be used frequently by a user as a hard floor cleaner since it is envisaged that a floor surface will require vacuuming more often than it requires wiping with a moist disposable wiping sheet. The floor tool is therefore not limited to using the floor pad in conjunction with the vacuuming facility.</p><p>The support member may include a carrier plate from which the removable pad is separable, the rolling arrangement being provided on the underside of the carrier plate.</p><p>Although the rolling arrangement could be embodied by rollers, spheres, casters, or even low-friction skids, one option is the rolling arrangement includes a plurality of wheels or rollers that depend down from the support member to define a plane of contact parallel to the floor surface.</p><p>The wheels or rollers may extend at least partially into apertures defined in the removable pad when the removable pad is coupled to the carrier plate.</p><p>In the floor tool as described above, there is a risk that the rather convoluted geometry of the suction nozzles and the fluid flow conduit can cause debris to be trapped within the fluid flow path of the tool. There is a need to mitigate this risk and thus, in a fourth aspect, the invention provides a floor tool for a vacuum cleaning appliance comprising a support member adapted to support a cleaning sheet and at least one suction nozzle in communication with a conduit, wherein the conduit includes one or more plug elements that are engageable with respective sockets provided in the conduits, the plugs being removable from the sockets to provide access to the interior of the conduit. The invention therefore provides a floor tool that combines suction and wipe-cleaning capability with improved user maintainability.</p><p>The plug elements may be secured to their respective sockets by way of a press- or screw-fit so that they are mounted securely. Optionally, the plug elements may include a tether which serves to retain the plug elements in a position close to the sockets when they are removed so as to reduce the likelihood of the plug elements being mislaid. Alternatively, the plug elements may be hinged relative to the conduit so that the elements can be hinged away from the sockets but still being attached to the conduit.</p><p>In the preferred embodiment, the manifold is configured in a central position on the support member and first and second suction nozzles are located against leading and trailing edges of the support member in the direction of movement. In this embodiment, the plug element, or elements, may be provided on the manifold which provides a central access point to the conduit increasing the ease at which blockages can be cleared. In one embodiment, first and second plug elements are provided at opposite ends of the manifold, which is substantially tubular. Therefore, access is provided at each end of the manifold and which also allows a cleaning implement to be pushed right through the manifold.</p><p>One advantage of the floor tool of the invention is that the ability of the floor tool to pick up dust, fluff and other debris from a floor surface is improved. Part of this benefit is achieved by arranging first and second suction chambers on either side of a wipe support member, but the performance improvement is also achieved by way of a configuration of the suction nozzles themselves. Therefore, from a fifth aspect, the invention provides a floor tool for a vacuum cleaning appliance, the floor tool comprising a main body including a suction nozzle comprising a surface engaging skirt that depends downwardly to define an outer periphery of a suction chamber having a suction chamber outlet, the surface engaging skirt including a leading edge, a trailing edge, and side edges extending between the leading edge and the trailing edge, and wherein the trailing edge depends downwardly from the suction nozzle by a first distance and the leading edge depends downwardly from the suction nozzle by a second distance that is less than the first distance so as to define a predetermined gap with a floor surface, in use.</p><p>In effect, therefore, the suction nozzle configuration provides a narrow gap substantially across the full width of the nozzle, although a full width gap is not essential, which gap enables a great amount of debris to be drawn into the suction nozzle and, therefore, to the associated vacuum cleaner. The skirt member may, in theory, be formed from any material that provides a strip-like member for engaging the floor surface and to form a seal with it so that airflow may get in to the suction nozzle primarily through the leading edge gap. For example, a wall of bristles may provide a suitable strip. However, it is preferred that the surface engaging skirt is flexible, so that is has the ability to confirm to a floor surface, and preferably a strip of plastics material, such as rubber.</p><p>Although the skirt may be formed from several pieces, each forming a substantially unbroken skirt, it may also be formed from a single strip of material. Preferably the strip of material is overmoulded onto the main body of the suction nozzle as this avoids more complicated techniques that would be required to attach a flexible strip or strips to the underside of the suction nozzle.</p><p>The precise dimensions of the gap are to some extent determined by the suction power of the vacuum cleaning device with which the floor tool is used. However, it is currently envisaged that a gap width of between mm and mm provides a suitable high speed air flow through the gap while admitting a wide range of debris to enter the floor tool through the gap. Most preferred is a gap width of about mm, that is to say that the leading edge depends downwardly from the suction nozzle by a distance that is between mm less than the distance of the trailing edge so as to define a gap of mm with the floor surface.</p><p>In one embodiment, a longitudinal wall extends along the suction chamber longitudinally to partition the suction chamber into front and rear suction channels. One or more openings may be provided in the longitudinal wall, or at the ends thereof, to allow fluid to flow through the openings between the front suction channel and the rear suction channel.</p><p>The skirt may also include a lateral wall that extends between the trailing edge and the leading edge, or between the trailing edge and the longitudinal wall, so as to partition the suction chamber into first and second sub-chambers each having an associated suction chamber outlet. The lateral wall may depend downward by the same amount as the trailing edge of the skirt or, alternatively by an amount the same as the leading edge of the skirt.</p><p>As mentioned above, the configuration of the suction nozzle increases the ability of the floor tool to pick up small debris in particularly and, importantly, dirt and debris that resides in crevices in the floor surface such as floorboard gaps etc. However, the fourth aspect of the invention has particular utility in the context of the dual function floor too which combines a suction function and also a hard floor wiping function. In this manner, the main body may include a support member adapted to support a cleaning sheet and wherein the suction nozzle lies adjacent a first edge of the supporting member.</p><p>Although such a floor tool may be adequate with a single suction nozzle, it is preferred that a further suction nozzle is provided that lies adjacent a second edge of the support member parallel to the first edge.</p><p>When two suction nozzles are provided the openings in the longitudinal wall in the first suction nozzle may be configured with a flow area that is different to the flow area of the openings in the longitudinal wall of the second suction nozzle. The effect of this is to bias the ‘suction power’ generated by the vacuum cleaner either more to the front or more to the rear suction nozzle.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the floor tool of the invention combines the functionality of a suction-type tool and a hard floor wipe implement. It is known to attach a wipe to a base plate by hook and loop fastening systems and also to wrap the wipe sheet around a base plate so that edges of the wipe sheet can be pushes into slit formations defined on the top of the wipe sheet. However, such attachment schemes can fail to hold the wipe sheet securely and the wipe sheet can tend to pull away from the attachment scheme during the back and forth movement of the floor tool. With a view to improving the means by which a wipe sheet is attachable to a suction-type floor tool, the invention therefore provides, in a sixth aspect, a floor tool for a vacuum cleaning appliance comprising a support member adapted to support a cleaning sheet and at least one suction nozzle adjacent the support member, wherein the support member includes a carrier pate and a floor engaging pad that are releasably held together by a clamping arrangement so that edges of a cleaning sheet can be clamped between the carrier plate and the floor pad in order to hold the cleaning sheet securely on the pad.</p><p>Such a configuration provides a particularly usable scheme for a user to attach a cleaning sheet to the floor tool, and one which fastens securely the cleaning sheet so that it cannot work itself loose during use. In one embodiment, once the cleaning sheet is wrapped around the floor pad, the clamping means is operable to automatically lock the floor pad to the carrier plate when the floor pad is pushed against the carrier plate. In this way a user simply has to push the carrier plate onto the pad and the two parts are locked together, which can be done form a standing position. This is particularly convenient from a user’s perspective.</p><p>The clamping means may include at least one button which is operable by a user to release the floor pad from the carrier plate. The button may be mounted to an upper surface of the floor pad about a pivot point and defines a latch face for cooperating with a catch face provided on the carrier plate. The automated latching of the button arrangement may be embodied by a catch face including an upper surface and an inclined lower surface which strikes a surface of the button as the floor pad is brought into contact with the plate, the inclined lower surface thereby urging the button to pivot clear of the catch to allow the floor pad to fully engage with the carrier plate, whereby the button return-pivots into a position to lock the floor pad to the carrier plate.</p><p>Although only a single button could be provided, which would cause one side of the pad to be releasable, in the preferred embodiment first and second user operable buttons are disposed at each end of an upper surface of the floor pad to engage with respective catches on the carrier plate.</p><p>Sufficient force to capture the cleaning sheet securely between the carrier plate and the floor pad may be provided by sandwiching the cleaning sheet between the two components. However, to increase the hold that the floor tool has on the sheet, the carrier plate/floor pad may further comprise a gripping arrangement configured to grip edges of a cleaning sheet in circumstance when a cleaning sheet is engaged between the floor pad and the carrier plate. The gripping arrangement may be defined by at least one rib provided on the floor pad, the rib being engageable with a respective channel provided on the carrier plate.</p><p>It should be appreciated that preferred and/or optional features of first, second, third fourth, fifth and sixth aspects of the invention may be combined with each other as appropriate.</p><p>Brief description of the drawings</p><p>Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p>Figure  is a perspective view of a vacuum cleaning appliance and associated floor tool in accordance with the invention;</p><p>Figure  is a perspective view from the front of the floor tool in Figure  isolated from the vacuum cleaner body;</p><p>Figure  is a perspective view from the rear of the floor tool in Figure ;</p><p>Figure  is a view like that in Figure , but with a neck of the floor tool partly removed to show an internal flow passage;</p><p>Figures a and b are perspective views of the floor tool in Figures  and  but with its suction nozzle assembly removed in order to show the way in which the neck connects to a support member of the floor tool;</p><p>Figures a and b are views like those in Figures a and b but the neck is in a reclined position;</p><p>Figure a is a side view of the floor tool which shows the support member of the floor tool in a raised position, and Figure b is a section view of Figure a along the line A-A;</p><p>Figure a is a view like that in Figure a but with the support member in a lowered position, and Figure b is a section view of Figure a along the line AA;</p><p>Figure  is a perspective view of the floor tool in an exploded form;</p><p>Figure  is a perspective view of the floor tool, from below, with the floor pad removed, in order to show a wheel arrangement of the floor tool;</p><p>Figure  is a side view of the floor tool in Figure ;</p><p>Figure  is a view from underneath of the floor tool in Figures  and ; and</p><p>Figure  is a view of a variant of the floor tool in Figure  from underneath.</p><p>Detailed description of the embodiments</p><p>With reference firstly to Figure , a vacuum cleaning appliance  of the so-called ‘stickvac cleaner’ type comprises a handheld vacuum cleaner  which can be carried in the hand of a user.</p><p>An elongate wand  is attached to the handheld vacuum cleaner  which reaches down to a floor tool  provided at the end of the wand , the floor tool  resting on a floor surface in normal use. Note that the floor surface itself is not shown explicitly in Figure , but its presence is implicit.</p><p>The handheld vacuum cleaner  comprises a motor-driven fan unit (not shown) which is arranged inside a motor casing  and draws air in through an air inlet nozzle  positioned at the front of the handheld vacuum cleaner . The elongate wand  is connected to the air inlet nozzle , and the floor tool  is in turn connected to the lower end of the wand . In use, dirty air is drawn in through the floor tool  and is ducted to the air inlet nozzle  through the wand . Dirty air that enters the air inlet nozzle  passes through a cyclonic separation system  that separates dirt from the air, and then relatively clean air is then exhausted back to the ambient environment via an exhaust  located at the rear. The dirt which is separated from the airflow inside the cyclonic separating system  is collected in a bin  for disposal. The hand held vacuum cleaner  is powered by a multi-cell rechargeable battery which is housed in a battery pack .</p><p>The floor tool  is detachable from the wand  by means of a catch . The wand  is in turn detachable from the handheld vacuum cleaner  by means of a further catch . The handheld vacuum cleaner  can thus be used in isolation as a standalone unit by detaching the wand  or, alternatively, the handheld vacuum cleaner , wand  and floor tool  can be used in combination as a hard floor cleaning device with a suction functionality.</p><p>It should be noted that the vacuum cleaner  in Figure  illustrates one potential configuration in which the floor tool  of the invention may be used. In the context of a stick-vac cleaner, the floor tool  provides a convenient and portable way in which to clean hard floors in particular. However, the floor tool  may also be used with other types of vacuum cleaners, for example connected to a wand and hose assembly of a cylinder or upright vacuum cleaner. Although it is preferred that the floor tool is connectable to an associated vacuum cleaner, this is not essential to the invention and the floor tool may be an integral component, for example integral to the wand in the handheld vacuum cleaner of Figure .</p><p>Turning also to Figures  and  which show the floor tool  in more detail, the floor tool  comprises a main body  and a pivotable neck  which serves to connect the floor tool  to a vacuum cleaner and enables a user to manoeuvre the floor tool across a surface to be cleaned.</p><p>The main body  comprises a suction nozzle assembly  and a generally oblong support member  on which can be carried a sheet-like cleaning element (not shown). The suction nozzle assembly  includes first and second elongate suction nozzles ,  arranged adjacent respective long edges of the support member .</p><p>In Figure , the floor tool  is oriented such that its ‘front’ is facing towards the left hand side of the drawing. Therefore, the first and second suction nozzles ,  can be considered to be a front suction nozzle  and a rear suction nozzle , respectively, and shall be referred to as such from now on.</p><p>The suction nozzle assembly  includes a central air manifold  that is mounted to an upper surface of the support member . Each of the first and second suction nozzles ,  are supported relative to the manifold  by first and second connecting arms  that extend away in opposite directions at either end of the manifold . Each of the connecting arms  is hollow and therefore serves as a fluid passageway along which air is ducted from the nozzles ,  to the manifold .</p><p>The manifold  is coupled to the neck  so that the neck  pivots about a central part of the manifold  located between the junctions  where the connecting arms  meet the manifold . However, as will become clear, although the neck may pivot around the manifold, the manifold is able to float up and down with respect to the neck. As marked on Figure , the neck  pivots about axis A.</p><p>The neck  has an open structure which houses a flexible hose  extending from the manifold  to an upper connecting part  of the neck . The neck  therefore serves to duct air from the suction nozzles ,  to an associated vacuum cleaner via the connecting part . As shown clearly in Figure , in which a part of the neck  has been removed for clarity, the flexible hose  extends from the connecting part  of the neck to a T-shaped junction pipe  that connects to both sides of the manifold  and therefore functions to converge air flowing through the manifold  into the flexible hose . The T-shaped pipe  is connected to the manifold  so as to be angularly movable about the axis A.</p><p>In Figures a and b, the suction nozzle assembly  has been removed so as to illustrate clearly the manner in which the neck  is pivotably connected to the support member . Broadly, the neck  comprises first and second neck sections ,  that cooperate with each other to define a universal joint. In this way, the first (lower) neck section  allows the neck to swing up and down relative the main body  about the axis A, and the second (upper) neck section  allows the connecting part  to pivot relative to the first section  about an axis B that is perpendicular to the axis A. This enables the floor tool  to be manoeuvred easily by a user such that a rotating movement of the wand results in the floor tool rotating in a plane parallel to the floor over a wide range of angles between the neck and the floor tool.</p><p>With this in mind, the first neck section  is generally cylindrical in form and engages with the support member  so that it can rotate about axis A. The first neck section  also includes a rectilinear or box-like extension  that extends away perpendicularly and defines an opening  through which the flexible hose  extends up through the interior of the neck . The second neck section  includes two parallel forks  that are journaled to the box-like extension  so as to be able to swing left and right about the axis B, being perpendicular to axis A.</p><p>The first neck section , more specifically the cylindrical portion of it, is engaged with the support member  by way of a rail formation . Each outer end or ‘rim’ of the first neck section  includes a rail portion  around part of its circumference in between an inwardly projecting flange  that extends about the remainder of the circumference. The rail portion  is retained under a projection  in the form of a tab or tooth defined by the support member . The projection  engages a discrete part of the rail portion  and runs along the rail portion  as the neck  is inclined up and down with respect to the support member . The projections  therefore act as a ‘runner formation’ that engage and cooperate with the rail portions  to allow the neck  to pivot. The term ‘discrete part’ is used to mean that the rail portion  engages only a sub-section of the rail portion , and this arrangement permits the neck section  to remain substantially open so that the manifold can pass through it.</p><p>It should be noted that Figures a and b show the neck in an inclined position, this position being limited by the engagement of the projections/runners  against an extreme end of the flange , whereas Figures a and b show the neck in a reclined position, the position being limited by the runners  engaging the other extreme end of the flange .</p><p>The rail arrangement  between the neck  and the support member  provides a direct connection between these two components so that the neck can apply a downward force to the support member  during cleaning. However, the coupling also envelops and retains the manifold  so that it is permitted to float with respect to the support member  and also, therefore, the neck . In this respect, the diameter of the first neck section  is larger than the diameter of the manifold  so that the manifold  can move relative to it. This is particularly advantageous, as it allows downwards force to be exerted on the support member  through the neck, which promotes the wiping action of the support member , whilst enabling the suction nozzles associated with the manifold  to ride lightly over the floor surface without being pressed down too forcefully. Since the suction nozzles are in light physical contact with the floor surface, the ability of the floor tool to remove dirt from crevices in the floor surface is improved.</p><p>In this embodiment, the manifold  is permitted approximately mm of vertical linear movement with respect to the support member , the amount of movement being determined by the difference in diameter between the manifold  and the neck , however it should be appreciated that the value of mm is given here as an example only and is not meant to be limitative. Accordingly, the skilled person would appreciate that by selecting the relative dimensions of the manifold and the neck appropriately, different degrees of float are possible.</p><p>The effect of the floating suction nozzles ,  is illustrated in the following figures: Figures a and b show the suction nozzles ,  in a lowered position with respect to the support member  and Figures a and b show the suction nozzles ,  in a raised position with respect to the support member . The movement of the manifold  relative to the support member  is guided by posts  formed on the underside of the manifold  which slidably engage with complementary shaped guide apertures  provided on the upper surface of the support member . The suction nozzles and the manifold are therefore able to move up and down in a vertical direction, that is to say, in a direction perpendicular to the floor surface. In use, therefore, the suction nozzles always rest on the floor surface lightly regardless of the thickness of the cleaning sheet that is being used on the tool. So, the support member  is able to accommodate cleaning sheets of different thicknesses without changing the ride height of the suction nozzles. So, the pickup performance of the floor tool  is retained regardless of the type of wipe element that is affixed to the support member.</p><p>Turning now to Figure , the ‘overslung’ configuration of the suction nozzle assembly in this embodiment configures the air flow passages with relatively sharp changes of direction and the skilled person will appreciate that there is the potential for debris to become trapped in parts of the suction nozzle assembly. This problem may present itself particularly with long debris, such as hair and fluff, which may catch around the angled pathways of the tool. To provide a solution to this, the manifold  is provided with access means comprising first and second caps  at opposed extreme ends of the manifold . The caps  are circular and are engagable in the open ends  of the manifold  by way of lugs  that mate with complementary channels  in the open ends  of the manifold  so as to define a twist-fit engagement. Such a twist-fit engagement is currently preferred since it relies on a positive action by a user to remove the caps. An alternative would be a simple press fit, possibly including a rubber o-ring to ensure a snug fitting, although a risk is that the caps  may become dislodged from the manifold  inadvertently. As a further alternative, the caps  may be coupled to the manifold  by a suitable retaining means so that they cannot be completely removed by a user. One way of achieving this would be to mount the caps  so that they pivot with respect to the manifold  and, in this way, a user could simply pivot the cap away from the manifold in order to gain access to its interior passages. Another alternative would be to retain the caps with some form of tether to allow a limited degree of separation between the manifold  and the caps .</p><p>It is of course possible that a user could remove debris from the manifold  if only a single cap were provided in one end of the manifold . However, the suction nozzle assembly  may more easily be maintained by having a cap at either end of the manifold, since access is provided into each end of the manifold and, by virtue of their location, also into the connecting arms . Furthermore, as the manifold  is tubular and generally linear, removing both caps  allows a visual inspection along the length of the manifold , and a cleaning implement such as a brush can be pushed right through it which helps with the removal of debris that may be stuck onto the internal surfaces of the manifold.</p><p>As has been mentioned, in a general sense, the floor tool  has a dual function: firstly, the support member  is adapted to carry a moisture bearing sheet of material, such as a commonly available poly-based disposable wipe, so that the floor tool  can be used to scrub stubborn stains and dirt from the floor surface; and secondly, the suction nozzles ,  remove loose dirt and debris from the floor surface for conveyance to the associated vacuum cleaner in a dirt-bearing airflow that is drawn through the floor tool. In order to carry a wipe element, the support member  comprises a floor pad  and a pad carrier plate  which are releasably held together so that a wipe sheet can be secured between them when the two parts are engaged, as will now be explained.</p><p>Figure  shows the floor pad  and the pad carrier plate  separated from one another. The floor pad  is generally oblong in shape and has an oblong recess  defined on its upper side into which the carrier plate  is receivable. In use, a cleaning sheet can be wrapped around the floor pad  such that ends of the cleaning sheet extend up and over the long edges  of the floor pad  so as to rest within the recess . The floor pad  is then engaged with the carrier plate  and secured to it which clamps the cleaning sheet in position.</p><p>The floor pad  is secured to the carrier plate  by way of a clamping arrangement . The clamping arrangement  comprises first and second latches ,  located at respective ends of the floor pad . The latches ,  are engageable with respective first and second catches ,  defined by recesses in each short edge of the carrier plate.</p><p>Each latch ,  comprises a user-operable button having a generally oval upper face  defining a shallow circular recess  that acts as a contact point for a finger of a user. The buttons , are preferably an engineering plastics such as a polycarbonate/polybutylene terephthalate blend (PC+PBT) which has good strength characteristics and chemical inertness and may be coloured so as to contrast with the surrounding components so that they stand out visually to a user. The high strength and chemical inertness of PC+PBT is preferred, but not essential, for the buttons since they will experience repeated actuation and in use will be subject to cleaning chemicals typically found in domestic cleaning sheets.</p><p>The buttons ,  are illustrated clearly in Figure b, in which the button  on the left hand side of the figure is in a depressed position and the button  on the right hand side of the figure is in a rest position. The buttons are identical in this embodiment so reference will be made to a single button for brevity. Each button ,  is pivotable about a pivot point  defined on the floor pad  and defines a latch face  extending towards the centre of the floor pad . Biasing means  in the form of a spring is provided to bias the button into the rest position. The latch face  is engageable with a cooperating catch surface  provided on an upstanding ledge  defined by the floor pad , the latch face  of the buttons and the catch surface  on the floor pad  cooperating to lock the carrier plate  to the floor pad  when the two components are pressed together firmly.</p><p>One benefit of the clamping arrangement  is that the buttons ,  lock automatically with the catches ,  which makes it easy for a user to assemble the components. To this end, the catches ,  include a lower surface  that is inclined upwardly thereby defining a cam surface. As the floor pad  is brought into contact with the carrier plate , the cam surface  of the catch contacts the upper surface  of the button. This contact causes the button ,  to move angularly about its pivot . Further movement of the floor pad  towards the carrier plate  causes the button to be bumped out of the way of the catch face  and then for the latch surface  to lock into the upper catch face , thereby securing the floor pad  to the carrier plate .</p><p>The carrier plate  and the floor pad  come together to secure a wipe element between them, and it is preferred, although not essential that engagement means are provided between the pad and the carrier plate to strengthen the clamping effect on the wipe element. In this embodiment, the engagement means comprises two elongate ribs  provided adjacent the respective long edges of the recess  on the floor pad  and these project into corresponding channels  provided on the underside of the carrier plate . The wipe element is therefore effectively clamped into position which reduces the likelihood of the wipe element working loose under the to-and-fro action of the floor tool, in use.</p><p>As well as combining the functionality of a hard floor wipe cleaner and a hard floor vacuuming tool, the floor tool  of the invention has the facility to be used in a purely vacuuming mode. This may be useful if a user wishes to vacuum the floor surface but does not consider it necessary wipe the floor as well. To this end, the carrier plate  includes a rolling arrangement  which supports the support member  on a floor surface in the absence of the floor pad .</p><p>In this embodiment, as shown clearly in Figure , the rolling arrangement  includes two pairs of wheels , although these could also be embodied as rollers or even skids. Each wheel  is held in a respective wheel cup  and has a rolling axis that extends parallel to the long axis of the floor tool  (axis A) so that the wheels  are oriented in the direction of travel of the floor tool, in use. As shown, the wheels  are arranged in pairs, each pair being aligned in a plane perpendicular to the axis A of the floor tool and, in this way, they provide a stable rolling contact point for the carrier plate  and bear the force that is applied to the floor tool  through the neck .</p><p>This is illustrated particularly well in Figure , in which the carrier plate  is in a lowered position with a force F being applied through the neck , the wheels  bear the carrier plate  on the floor surface S, whilst the suction nozzles ,  are free to float relative to the carrier plate . It will be appreciated that key to this scheme is that the wheels  act as a bearing point for the carrier plate so, in this context, a suitable set of skids and rails would also perform the same function and should therefore be considered to be encompassed by the term ‘rolling arrangement’.</p><p>Such a tool may, in practice, be used frequently by a user as a hard floor cleaner since it is envisaged that a floor surface will require vacuuming more often than it requires wiping with a moist disposable wiping sheet. The floor tool is therefore not limited to using the floor pad in conjunction with the vacuuming facility which enhances the versatility of the floor tool.</p><p>In circumstances where the floor pad  is attached to the carrier plate , the wheel cups are received in respective apertures  provided in the floor pad , as is shown in Figure .</p><p>A further advantageous feature of the floor tool  of the invention is the configuration of the suction nozzles , , which provide the floor tool  with particularly good debris pickup performance on hard floors, as will now be explained.</p><p>With particular reference to Figures  and , each of the front and rear suction nozzles ,  includes a generally rectangular floor engaging skirt  that depends downwardly from a rigid upper portion or ‘spine’  of the suction nozzle. A further member or ‘dividing wall’  extends transversely between long edges of the skirt  approximately mid-way between the two ends of the suction nozzles and therefore divides the suction nozzles into a first suction chamber  and a second suction chamber , located side by side.</p><p>The outer peripheral skirt/wall  of the suction chambers ,  and also the dividing wall  are, in this embodiment, an integral body made of plastics material, although it is envisaged that the skirt  may be made from a plurality of individual strips. In the preferred embodiment, the skirts  are a thermoplastic elastomer and are overmoulded onto the spine  of the suction nozzles, although it should be appreciated that this is not essential and the skirts could also be inserted into slots defined in the suction nozzle. As a further alternative, the skirts  may also be formed from bristles, although currently flexible plastics or rubber strips are preferred for their durability and since they don’t tend to capture debris as can occur with bristles.</p><p>Each skirt  can be considered to include a trailing edge  which is located directly adjacent a respective long edge  of the floor pad , and a leading edge  that is remote from the floor pad . Furthermore, side edges  extend between the leading and trailing edges ,  thereby completing the oblong sealing skirt .</p><p>In order to promote good debris pickup performance, substantially the entire leading edge  of the skirt  is shorter than the trailing edge  so that it is spaced from the floor surface ‘S’ when in use. This is shown clearly in Figure  which illustrates the spacing as dimension ‘L’. In this embodiment, the spacing or gap ‘L’ is mm, although a larger or smaller gap still provides benefits. The key consideration is that the spacing L is selected to maximise flow velocity through the suction nozzles ,  given the suction that is applied to the floor tool  whilst still allowing debris of a useful range of sizes to enter into the suction chambers , .</p><p>Configuring the leading edge  of the suction nozzle so that it is spaced from the floor surface S in this way avoids ‘snowploughing’ debris in front of the suction nozzle during cleaning that may occur with known floor tools having apertured or ’castellated’ leading edges as is often found on existing hard floor tools. Furthermore, by configuring both the front and rear suction nozzles in this way, the same advantage is achieved during forward and reverse strokes of the floor tool, although this is not essential.</p><p>Conversely, the trailing edge  of the suction nozzles ,  defines a straight linear edge that engages the floor surface in the manner of a lip seal or ‘squeegee’ to guard against debris accumulating on the cleaning sheet. Beneficially, this avoids the floor surface being marked as well as extending the life of the cleaning sheet.</p><p>Each of the adjacent suction chambers ,  is further provided with an additional floor engaging member , also in the form of a rubber strip, which defines an interior wall extending longitudinally within the respective suction chamber , . The interior wall  or ‘longitudinal strip’ divides the interior of the first and second suction chambers ,  into first and second longitudinal suction channels (front and rear suction channels, respectively) ,  which are fluidly linked by apertures or notches ,  formed in the strips  thereby defining ‘connecting channels’. As can be seen clearly in Figure , each suction nozzle ,  includes two suction outlets  that lead into the connecting arms , one outlet  emerging into the rear of the suction channels  in each suction chamber , .</p><p>In use, with the floor tool located on a floor surface, the application of suction to the floor tool  by an associated vacuum cleaner generates two different pressure regions within each suction chamber ,  of each suction nozzle , . Due to the relatively tight seal formed around the rear suction channels  by the trailing edge  and side edges , a relatively high vacuum is established in the rear suction channels . This promotes a relatively high-speed air flow which benefits the entrainment of debris located within crevices in the floor surface into the airflow through the rear suction channels . Furthermore, since the trailing edge  is straight and uniform, this reduces the likelihood of debris passing under the trailing edge which protects the wipe element and the floor pad from debris pickup.</p><p>The provision of the connecting channels ,  establishes a relatively low vacuum in the front suction channels  to enable dust and relatively large debris located on the floor surface to be entrained within a fluid flow drawn into the front suction channels  through the leading edge gap L. This dirt-bearing fluid flow is then conveyed from the front suction channels  through the connecting channels ,  to the rear suction channel  and then into the connecting arms  of the suction nozzle assembly. From there, the airflow continues to the manifold and to the flexible hose.</p><p>It should be noted that the apertures ,  defined in the longitudinal strips  in the front and rear suction nozzles ,  are not equal in size. More specifically, the apertures  in the front suction nozzle  are semi-circular in form and have a larger flow area than the apertures  in the rear suction nozzle  that are rectangular in form. In this particular embodiment, the apertures  in the front suction nozzle  are semicircles with a radius of mm, the centre of radius being located on the lower edge of the strip , therefore resulting in a flow area of approximately mm , whereas the dimensions of the apertures  in the rear suction nozzle  are mm by mm resulting in a flow area of approximately mm . It should be noted that these values are only exemplary.</p><p>The lower flow area defined by the apertures  in the rear suction nozzle  increases the resistance to air flow of the rear suction nozzle , which has the effect of increasing the flow through the front suction nozzle  in comparison. Therefore, the suction ‘power’ that is applied to the floor tool is biased towards the front suction nozzle  thereby increasing the pickup performance in the front nozzle , which is beneficial since it is the front suction nozzle that leads as a user pushes the tool along a floor surface.</p><p>By dividing the suction nozzles into two separate chambers , , with each of the chambers having respective front and rear suction channels ,  it can be assured that a high speed fluid flow through the suction chambers is experienced across the whole width of the floor tool which greatly promotes debris entrainment and pickup. Furthermore, the recessed leading edge  reduces snowploughing of debris and thus further improves pickup performance of the floor tool.</p><p>Further advantages may be realised by removal of a section of the dividing wall  of the embodiment in Figure . Figure  illustrates this, and it can be seen that a front section of the dividing wall in Figure  has been removed leaving only a rear section  of dividing wall that extending between the longitudinal strips  and the trailing edge  of the skirts . Therefore, a single front suction channel  extends across substantially the entire width of the suction nozzles. Removal of the front section of dividing wall eliminates any ‘dead space’ within the front suction channel where debris could hesitate or become stuck.</p><p>Alternatively, the front section of the dividing wall  in Figure  need not be removed completely as in the embodiment of Figure . In one embodiment, the front section of the dividing wall  may be configured so that is it shallower than the rear section of dividing wall. This leaves a small gap between the lower edge of the front section of the dividing wall and the floor surface which means that air flow can bleed through the gap between the front two chambers , . This improves debris pickup by guarding against any dead spots in the front chambers ,  but still provides structural support to the longitudinal walls .</p><p>It is possible for variations to be made to the specific embodiments described above without departing from the scope of the invention defined by the claims. For example, the supporting member has been described above as rectangular, but the skilled person will appreciate that other shapes are also viable; the supporting member could also be triangular, diamond-shaped, or even oval, with appropriately modified suction nozzles.</p><p>Also, although the supporting member has been described as being particularly suitable for use with a non poly-based non-woven cleaning sheet, it should be appreciated that this is not essential to the invention and it may also be used with other types of wiping members such as woven cleaning cloths. Still alternatively, the supporting member may carry a porous cleaning member such as a sponge pad that is secured on its underside, by a hook-and-loop type fastening system for example, or formed integrally with it.</p><p>Although the floor tool may in principle be made from a wide range of materials, plastics are currently preferred for their cost effectiveness and ease of manufacture since parts can be formed, for example by injection moulding, into almost any desired shape. In the context of the floor tool of the invention, the choice of plastics influences the effectiveness and the long term durability of the floor tool since it is designed to be used with wipes that contain a variety of chemicals which may have a detrimental impact on some plastics.</p><p>Preferably, the first and second neck portions are made from injection moulded PC-PBT since this material is strong yet resistant to chemical attack. The neck connector is preferably talc-filled polypropylene (PP) since this provides increased strength to this part so as to withstand the forces applied to it via the wand, but is more cost effective that PC-PBT.</p><p>The suction nozzle assembly is predominantly formed from polypropylene, apart from the skirt which is thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) which is preferably overmoulded onto a respective spine of a suction nozzle.</p><p>Turning to the support member, it is currently envisaged that the carrier is injection moulded talc-filled polypropylene for increased strength, and the floor pad is a combination of polypropylene for the upper surface to provide strength and thermoplastic elastomer plus a blowing agent as the body of the floor pad to provide it with a degree of resilience which improves the contact with the floor surface.</p></description>



       "'<description lang=\"en\" load-source=\"lhip\" data-format=\"original\"><p>Vehicle</p><p>The present invention relates to a vehicle, in particular a working vehicle.</p><p>Known working vehicles, such as back hoe loaders have a materials handling implement such as a loading shovel mounted on the front of the machine and a further materials handling implement such as a back hoe, mounted on the back of a machine.</p><p>When the operator wishes to use the loading shovel the seat is orientated in a forwards facing direction and the operator can use controls such as the steering wheel, a foot brake, a foot clutch, a foot accelerator, a gear box having forward and reverse gears, and hand operated controls to lift and lower a loading arm and crowd or dump the loading shovel in order to manoeuvre material.</p><p>When it is necessary to move the back hoe loader from one location to another location, typically via public highway, the loading shovel will be lifted above ground level and the back hoe loader can be driven, in the manner of a car (automobile) with the operator facing forwards and using the steering wheel, brake, clutch and throttle controls.</p><p>When using the back hoe the seat can be rotated to face rearwardly. When using the back hoe the vehicle will be stationary, and indeed some or all of the wheels may be lifted off the ground by operation of stabiliser legs and/or lowering of the front shovel into engagement with the ground. When operating the back hoe various hydraulic rams will be needed to operated which are supplied by pressurised hydraulic fluid from a pump driven by the engine. The power required to drive the pump may require the engine to be set at an engine speed above a normal idle speed. In order to set the engine speed above a normal idle speed a hand throttle is provided which is located in a convenient position for operation by the operator when the seat is facing rearwardly.</p><p>Furthermore, because the back hoe loader has a hydraulic pump driven by an engine, it is possible to connect an external service, such as a hydraulically operated water pump or other hydraulically operated external machine tools such as a breaker hammer, an earth drill, a submersible pump, a disc cutter, a diamond core drill, an impact wrench, a vibratory plate etc. Under these circumstances the vehicle will be stationary and it is not necessary for an operator to be in the cab. The external service may require the engine to be set at a working speed which is above idle speed, in which the case the hand throttle is utilised to set an appropriate engine speed.</p><p>Also an auto idle function is known whereby if the hand throttle has been used to set an engine working speed then if the system detects that the engine is not operating a load, then the engine speed may be reduced to a speed less than the working speed, and may be reduced to an idle speed, thereby saving fuel. The engine speed may be reduced to an idle speed in one step or may be progressively reduced to an idle speed. Upon the application of a load, the engine speed will increase to the working speed as set by the hand throttle. Thus, the system saves fuel if no work is being done but nevertheless automatically returns to the hand throttle speed setting (the “working speed”) when work is restarted, thereby not requiring the operator to reset the engine speed.</p><p>Thus according to the present invention there is provided a vehicle including an engine, the engine being selectably operably couplable to ground engaging motive means, the vehicle including a foot throttle for selectively controlling power delivery from the engine, a hand throttle for selectively controlling power delivery from the engine and an operator seat being moveable between a front facing position and a rear facing position, the vehicle including a static operating mode in which:the operator seat faces forwards, the engine is decoupled from the ground engaging motive means and/or a park brake is on, and the foot throttle is the default throttle the vehicle further including an excavation mode in which:the operator seat faces rearwards, the engine is decoupled from the ground engaging motive means and the hand throttle is the default throttle.</p><p>Thus, according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a vehicle including an engine, the engine being selectably operably couplable to ground engaging motive means, the vehicle including a foot throttle for selectively controlling power delivery from the engine, a hand throttle for selectively controlling power delivery from the engine and an operator seat being moveably between a front facing position and a rear facing position, the vehicle including a transport operating mode in which:the operator seat faces forwards, the engine is coupled to the ground engaging motive means and/or a park brake is off, and the foot throttle is the default throttle the vehicle further including an excavation mode in which:the operator seat faces rearwards, the engine is decoupled from the ground engaging motive means, the hand throttle is the default throttle.</p><p>Thus, according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a vehicle including an engine, the engine being selectably operably couplable to ground engaging motive means, the vehicle including a foot throttle for selectively controlling power delivery from the engine, a hand throttle for selectively controlling power delivery from the engine and an operator seat being moveable between a front facing position and a rear facing position, the vehicle including a static operating mode in which:the operator seat faces forwards, the engine is decoupled from the ground engaging motive means and/or a park brake is on, and the foot throttle is the default throttle the vehicle including a transport operating mode in which:the operator seat faces forwards, the engine is coupled to the ground engaging motive means and/or a park brake is off, and the foot throttle is the default throttle the vehicle further including an excavation mode in which:the operator seat faces rearwards, the engine is decoupled from the ground engaging motive means and the hand throttle is the default throttle.</p><p>Thus, according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of operating a vehicle as defined in any preceding claim including the step of:operating the vehicle in the static operating mode with the engine operating at an idle speed and with the hand operated control set at a working speed above an idle speed, the method further including the step of moving the seat to the rear facing position to enable the excavation mode such that the engine speed increases to the working speed.</p><p>The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:Figure  is a side view of a vehicle according to the present invention,</p><p>Figure  is a side view of the vehicle of figure  with the operator seat facing rearwardly, and</p><p>Figure  shows a plan schematic view of the vehicle of figure  and  showing various directions in which the seat can face.</p><p>With reference to figure  there is shown a material handling vehicle in the form of a back hoe loader  having a chassis  supported by ground engaging motive means in the form of wheels . Mounted on the chassis is a loading arm  at the front of which is mounted an implement, in this case a loading shovel . The loading arm and loading shovel are mounted on the front of the vehicle.</p><p>Mounted on the back of the vehicle is a back hoe  having a boom , a dipper arm , and a bucket . The vehicles includes an engine  which provides power to drive the vehicle over the ground. The engine  also provides power to operate a hydraulic pump which can selectively provide pressurised hydraulic fluid to the various rams  of the vehicle to operate the loading arm, loading shovel, boom, dipper, bucket etc so as to enable material to be handled. The vehicles includes an operator cab  including an operator seat . The operator cab includes operator controls such as a steering wheel , a foot brake , a foot throttle , a hand throttle  and back hoe control lever .</p><p>As shown in figure  the operator seat  is facing forwards. The operator seat is rotatable and can be rotated to the position shown in figure  where it faces the rear of the vehicle. The vehicle includes a seat position sensor  which can determine if the seat is facing forwards as shown in figure  or facing the rear as shown in figure . When being moved from the figure  position to the figure  position the seat rotates anticlockwise when viewed from above. The seat position sensor  may be able to determine one or more intermediate positions of the seat between the forward facing position shown in figure  and the rear facing position shown in figure .</p><p>The vehicle includes a cab door  on the left hand side of the vehicle. Thus, starting with the operator in the cab with the seat positioned as shown in figure , if the operator wishes to exit the cab then the seat may be turned towards the operators left (i.e. anticlockwise when viewed from above) so that the seat faces the door (i.e. the seat is partially facing forwards and partially facing to the left of the vehicle). In this position it is easy for the operator to exit the cab through the door. Alternatively, starting with the seat in the position as shown in figure , if the operator wishes to operate the back hoe, then the seat can be rotated through ° to the position shown in figure .</p><p>Under some circumstances the back hoe may be predominantly operated on the left hand side of the vehicle (when considering the forwards direction of the vehicle) i.e. on the right hand side of the operator when the seat is in the figure  position. Under these circumstances, it is convenient for the seat to be turned slightly clockwise (when viewed from above) from the figure  position to a position where the seat faces partially towards the rear of the vehicle and partially towards the left side of the vehicle.</p><p>Figure  shows a schematic plan view of the back hoe loader . F indicates the front of the back hoe loader and R represents the back of the back hoe loader. LS represents the left side of the back hoe loader. Arrows , , , ,  and  represent the direction in which the seat can be positioned to face.</p><p>Thus, arrow  represents the seat facing a forwards direction as shown in figure . Arrow  represents the seat facing a rearward direction as shown in figure . Arrow  represents the seat facing partially forwards and partially towards the left hand side. This is the position at which the seat will typically be facing when the operator exits the cab through the door . Arrows ,  and  show the direction in which the seat may be facing when the operator is using the back hoe primarily when the back hoe is positioned on the left hand side of the vehicle. Arrows ,  and  represent the seat facing partially backwards and partially towards the left hand side.</p><p>The seat position sensor  may be able to determine when the seat is in one or more of positions , , , ,  and , and may also be able to determine when the seat is in any intermediate position between positions  and . A seat lock may be provided to lock the seat in one or more of positions , , , , ,  or any intermediate position.</p><p>The back hoe loader has certain operating modes.</p><p>Thus, the vehicle has a static operating mode. In this mode the operator seat faces forwards as shown in figure . The engine is decoupled from the ground engaging motive means, e.g. a gear box may be in neutral such that the engine does not drive the wheels .</p><p>The vehicle also has a transport mode. In the transport mode the operator faces forwards. The engine is coupled to the ground engaging motive means, for example the gear box will be in gear and the engine will be turning the wheels  either in a forwards direction or a reverse direction.</p><p>The vehicle also has an excavation mode. In the excavation mode the operator seat faces rearwards as shown in figure . The engine is decoupled from the ground engaging motive means, e.g. the gear box is in neutral.</p><p>When the particular requirements of an operating mode are satisfied, then the control of the engine will default to a particular throttle. Thus when the requirements of the static operating mode are met, the control of the engine will default to the foot throttle. When the particular operating requirements of the transport mode are met, then the control of the engine will default to the foot throttle. When the particular requirements of the excavation mode are met, then control of the engine will default to the hand throttle.</p><p>For certain modes, once in that mode the control of the engine can be transferred away from the default throttle. Furthermore, once the control has been transferred away from the default throttle, it can be transferred back to the default throttle.</p><p>Consider the following sequence of events.</p><p>The operator\\'s seat is facing forwards and the gear box is in neutral. The engine is running at idle speed.</p><p>The operator turns the seat to face rearwards. Once this has been done the conditions for the excavation mode have been met and accordingly the engine control defaults to the hand throttle. Thus if the hand throttle has been set to  rpm, then the engine will run at  rpm and if the hand throttle has been set to  rpm, then the engine will run at  rpm.</p><p>If the seat is then turned to face forwards, then the static operating mode conditions are met and the engine control defaults to the foot throttle. Typically as the seat turns to face forwards, the operator\\'s foot will not be on the foot throttle and accordingly the foot throttle will be set to an idle speed and hence the engine rpm will fall to that idle speed. Should the operator depress the foot throttle to a  rpm position, then the engine speed will increase to  rpm. Should the operator release the foot pedal, then the engine speed will return to an idle rpm.</p><p>In the static operating mode it is possible to transfer engine control to the hand throttle by setting the hand throttle at an idle speed level above the instant engine speed level set by the foot throttle. Thus if the position of the foot throttle is at idle, then operating the hand throttle to a position of above idle will transfer the engine control away from the foot throttle and to the hand throttle. Subsequently the hand throttle can be increased to increase the engine speed and to decrease the engine speed.</p><p>Engine control can be transferred back to the foot throttle simply by operating the foot throttle. Alternatively engine control can be transferred back to foot throttle by operating a brake pedal. Alternatively engine control can be transferred to the foot throttle by engaging a gear. The reason engine control transfers to the foot throttle is that by engaging a gear the conditions for transport mode are met (i.e. the seat is facing forward and the engine is coupled to the ground engaging motive means, and in these circumstances the default throttle control is the foot throttle.</p><p>When in transport mode, it is not possible to transfer engine control to the hand throttle.</p><p>Having a default throttle for a particular mode has certain advantages. The default throttle is the most appropriate throttle for the majority of operations to be carried out in that mode.</p><p>In a static mode where an external machine tool is being used, the operator can increase the engine speed using the foot throttle to a level appropriate for the machine tool. The operator can then transfer that foot throttle setting to the hand throttle setting by increasing the hand throttle to (just) above the foot throttle level. Thus the operator can quickly set and hold an engine speed appropriate for a machine tool. In the event that final adjustment of the engine speed is required, then the operator can increase or decrease the engine speed accordingly by using the hand throttle. Should the operator wish to transfer engine speed control to the foot throttle, then the operator can simply operate the foot throttle, whereupon engine speed will be determined by foot throttle position.</p><p>When in the transport mode the default throttle (the foot throttle) is the only throttle that can control the engine, i.e. it is not possible to control the engine by the hand throttle.</p><p>By way of example, consider the situation where the operator is required to dig a trench. The operator will drive the vehicle in the transport mode to a position where the start of the trench is to be dug. The operator will then turn the seat ° and operate the machine in excavation mode to dig the first part of the trench. After a short while it would become necessary for the operator to move the machine forwards to continue the trench. This is done by turning the seat to the forwards direction, driving the machine forwards (in transport mode) perhaps the length of the machine wheelbase, turning the seat to face rearwardly and then operating the machine in excavation mode to dig a continuation part of the trench. The operator will then continue to turn the seat, drive the machine forward, turn the seat and continue to excavate the trench until such time as the whole length of the trench has been dug.</p><p>A transport mode and excavation mode of the present invention reduce the drive fatigue as follows.</p><p>By way of example, the engine of the working machine may idle at  revs per minute (rpm). Under certain conditions it may be necessary to run the engine at  rpm to operate the back hoe to excavate the trench. Under these circumstances the hand throttle can be set to run the engine at  rpm. Significantly, the hand throttle can be left at this setting which therefore does not need to be changed by the operator. Under these circumstances, when digging a trench, the following sequence of events happens :When the machine is being manoeuvred in the transport mode so as to position the back hoe over the start of the trench, because in the transport mode the foot throttle is the default throttle, then when the operator removes his or her foot from the throttle pedal the engine will return to an idle speed and when the operator needs to move the vehicle forwards or backwards the foot throttle can be used to vary the vehicle speed. Once the vehicle has been positioned, the operator will turn the seat in an anticlockwise direction. Because the operator is sitting in the seat, as the operator and seat turn together, the operators right foot, which operates the foot throttle, will naturally be moved away from the foot throttle and the engine will therefore return to an idle speed if not already at an idle speed. Once the seat position sensor  determines that the seat is facing rearwardly, the vehicle then operates in the excavation mode. Since in the excavation mode the hand throttle is the default throttle, and since the hand throttle has previously been set to  rpm, the act of rotating the seat from the forwards position to the rearwards position results in the engine speed increasing from idle ( rpm) to  rpm. Thus as soon as the seat reaches the reward facing position the engine revs are increased to a speed wherein the back hoe can be operated and the operator can immediately start digging the trench. Significantly, as the seat moves to the rearward facing position it is not necessary for the operator to operate the hand control to speed up the engine speed (since this is done automatically by virtue of the criteria of the excavation mode being met) and this saves time.</p><p>Once the first part of the trench has been dug the operator then turns the seat from the rearward facing position to the forward facing position. This will result in the machine no longer being in the excavation mode rather it will initially return to the static mode as the seat tends to face forwards. This means that the foot throttle will control the engine speed which will therefore drop from  rpm down to an idle speed of  rpm. This idle speed is a suitable engine speed for the transport mode of operation. Thus as the seat swings to the forwards position the engine revs drop down to  rpm idle speed and then the operator can immediately put the machine in transport mode to move the vehicle over the ground. Since in transport mode the default throttle is the foot throttle, varying of the engine speed is done via the foot throttle. Once the machine has been repositioned, the operator then swings the seat from the forwards facing position to the rearwards facing position, the act of which causes the engine speed to increase from idle speed to the preset  rpm speed set by the hand throttle and the machine is immediately able to continue digging the trench. Thus, once the hand throttle has been set once (in this example to  rpm) then the whole of the trench can be dug without the operator ever having to touch or adjust the hand throttle. As far as the operator is concerned, when the seat faces forwards the engine will be running at idle speed unless the operator operates the foot throttle and this is the normally expected operating mode with a forward facing seat (akin to driving a car (automobile)). When the seat is facing rearwardly the engine speed will always be at the operator desired working speed (in this case  rpm) as set by the hand throttle. As such, operator fatigue is reduced since the engine runs at a speed appropriate for the direction in which the seat is facing.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment vehicles according to the present invention may also include an auto idle function. As mentioned above, an auto idle function operates if the hand throttle has been used to set an engine working speed above and idle speed.</p><p>The auto idle function may be enabled or may be disabled, depending upon operator preference.</p><p>Digging a trench or the like, often carried out in conjunction with a manual labourer working outside the cab sometimes in or near the trench or the like. The manual labourer may look out for buried water pipes, gas pipes, electricity cables or other buried articles which need to be avoided by the machine implement and which sometimes the machine operator cannot readily see. Accordingly communication between the machine operator and the manual labourer is important. Advantageously where a machine has an auto idle function, and where it is enabled, when the criteria for the excavation mode are met, then the auto idle function can reduce the engine speed below a level set by the hand throttle. Typically the auto idle will reduce the engine speed to the idle speed.</p><p>Thus under these circumstances consider the scenario where a trench is being dug in conjunction with a manual labourer and the machine has been advanced forwards in order to dig a further part of the trench. As the operator starts to swing the seat towards the excavation position his or her foot will come off the foot throttle and the engine will therefore be running at an idle speed (if it is not already running at idle speed). As the seat reaches the rearward facing position, the criteria for the excavation mode are met, but additionally the auto idle function moderates the hand throttle setting. In one example, rather than the engine speed increases to  rpm (as set by the hand throttle) as the seat reaches the rear facing position, the engine speed remains at idle speed ( rpm). Because the engine is running slower it produces less noise and the machine operator is able to talk to the manual labourer. Once between them they decide to continue digging the trench, then as soon as the machine operator operates the back hoe, the auto idle system will automatically cause the engine speed to revert back to the hand throttle speed setting (the working speed, in this case  rpm). As will be appreciated, operating machine in this manner does not require the operator to adjust the hand throttle and this is therefore time saving.</p><p>As mentioned above, in vehicles according to the present invention when using the transport mode the hand throttle cannot be used to control engine speed. Accordingly, the hand throttle cannot be used as a form of cruise control. Vehicles according to the present invention may therefore include an operator actuated speed hold device (such as a button or switch or the like) which, when actuated maintains the current speed of the engine or endeavours to achieve a desired engine speed as indicated by a foot throttle. This can act as a cruise control device. Thus, when the operator reaches a desired vehicle speed, which equates to a particular engine speed in a particular gear, then he or she can operate the operator actuated speed hold device so as to maintain the speed of the engine, and hence maintain the speed of the vehicle. The operator actuated speed hold device can be disabled either by actuating the operator actuated speed hold device again and/or by operating the brake pedal and/or by operating a park brake lever or the like and/or by decoupling the engine from the ground engaging motive means, for example by putting a gearbox into neutral.</p><p>The vehicle may have various sensors, for example a foot throttle position sensor, a hand throttle position sensor, a seat position sensor (as mentioned above), a gearbox neutral sensor. The foot throttle may be mechanically coupled to the engine to control the engine speed. The hand throttle may be mechanically coupled to the engine to control the engine speed.</p><p>The foot throttle may not be mechanically coupled to the engine. The hand throttle may not be mechanically coupled to the engine. The foot throttle may include a foot throttle sensor for sensing a position of the foot throttle representative of a desired engine speed. The hand throttle may include a hand throttle sensor for determining a position of the hand throttle representative of a desired engine speed. Signals from a foot throttle sensor and/or a hand throttle sensor may be fed to a control unit. Signals from a seat position sensor may be fed to a control unit. Signals from a neutral sensor may be fed to a control unit. Dependent upon the signals received by a control unit the control unit may determine a mode of operation of the vehicle.</p><p>As described above, the engine may be coupled to a ground engaging means by a gear box which enables driving in a forwards direction or a reverse direction. The invention is not restricted to vehicles having gearboxes having forward and reverse gears. In a further embodiment the vehicle may include a hydrostatic transmission which can drive the wheels in a forwards or reverse direction by virtue of pumping pressurised hydraulic fluid as is well known in the art.</p><p>As mentioned above, in transport mode the operator faces forwards, the engine is coupled to the ground engaging means. In an alternative transport mode the operator faces forwards, an operator control indicative of a desire to move the vehicle over the ground is actuated. One example of an operator control indicative of a desire to move the vehicle over ground is the engagement of a gear of a gearbox. Alternatively, the release of a parking brake is indicative of a desire to move the vehicle over the ground. Alternatively, where the vehicle has a hydrostatic transmission, the movement of a control that actuates the hydrostatic transmission such that the vehicle can move forwards or can move backwards is indicative of a desire to move the vehicle over the ground.</p></description>'"
